"36  yes, others received their trial by mockings and scourgings, indeed, more than that, by chains+ and prisons.+"
"37  they were stoned,+ they were tried, they were sawn in two,* they were slaughtered by the sword,+ they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins,+ while they were in need, in tribulation,+ mistreated;+"
38  and the world was not worthy of them. they wandered about in deserts and mountains and caves+ and dens of the earth. 
"39  and yet all of these, although they received a favorable witness because of their faith, did not obtain the fulfillment of the promise,"
"40  because god had foreseen something better for us,+ so that they might not be made perfect apart from us."
"2  that is why it is necessary for us to pay more than the usual attention to the things we have heard,+ so that we never drift away.+"
"2  for if the word spoken through angels+ proved to be sure, and every transgression and disobedient act received a punishment in harmony with justice,+"
"3  how will we escape if we have neglected so great a salvation?+ for it began to be spoken through our lord+ and was verified for us by those who heard him,"
4  while god joined in bearing witness with signs and wonders* and various powerful works+ and with the holy spirit distributed according to his will.+ 
"5  for it is not to angels that he has subjected the inhabited earth to come,+ about which we are speaking."
"6  but in one place a certain witness said: “what is man that you keep him in mind, or a son of man that you take care of him?+"
"7  you made him a little lower than angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and appointed him over the works of your hands."
"8  all things you subjected under his feet.”+ by subjecting all things to him,+ god left nothing that is not subject to him.+ now, though, we do not yet see all things in subjection to him.+"
"9  but we do see jesus, who was made a little lower than angels,+ now crowned with glory and honor for having suffered death,+ so that by god’s undeserved kindness he might taste death for everyone.+ "
"10  for it was fitting that the one for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory,+ should make the chief agent of their salvation+ perfect through sufferings.+"
"11  for both the one who is sanctifying and those who are being sanctified+ all stem from one,+ and for this reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers,+"
12  as he says: “i will declare your name to my brothers; in the midst of the congregation i will praise you with song.”+
"13  and again: “i will put my trust in him.”+ and again: “look! i and the young children, whom jehovah* gave me.”+ "
"14  therefore, since the “young children” are sharers of blood and flesh, he also similarly shared in the same things,+ so that through his death he might bring to nothing the one having the means to cause death,+ that is, the devil,+"
15  and that he might set free* all those who were held in slavery all their lives by their fear of death.+
"16  for it is not really angels he is assisting, but he is assisting abraham’s offspring.*+"
"17  consequently, he had to become like his “brothers” in all respects,+ so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to god, in order to offer a propitiatory sacrifice*+ for the sins of the people.+"
"18  since he himself has suffered when being put to the test,+ he is able to come to the aid of those who are being put to the test.+"
"4  therefore, since a promise of entering into his rest remains, let us be on guard* for fear someone among you seems to fall short of it.+"
"2  for we have also had the good news declared to us,+ just as they had; but the word that they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened."
"3  for we who have exercised faith do enter into the rest, just as he has said: “so i swore in my anger, ‘they will not enter into my rest,’”+ although his works were finished from the founding of the world.+"
"4  for in one place he has said of the seventh day as follows: “and god rested on the seventh day from all his works,”+"
5  and here again he says: “they will not enter into my rest.”+ 
"6  therefore, since it remains for some to enter into it, and those to whom the good news was first declared did not enter in because of disobedience,+"
"7  he again marks off a certain day by saying long afterward in david’s psalm, “today”; just as it has been said above, “today if you listen to his voice, do not harden your hearts.”+"
"8  for if joshua+ had led them into a place of rest, god would not afterward have spoken of another day."
9  so there remains a sabbath-rest for the people of god.+
"10  for the man who has entered into god’s rest has also rested from his own works, just as god did from his own.+ "
"11  let us therefore do our utmost to enter into that rest, so that no one may fall into the same pattern of disobedience.+"
"12  for the word of god is alive and exerts power+ and is sharper than any two-edged sword+ and pierces even to the dividing of soul* and spirit,* and of joints from the marrow, and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart."
"13  and there is not a creation that is hidden from his sight,+ but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of the one to whom we must give an account.+ "
"14  therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, jesus the son of god,+ let us hold on to our public declaration of him.+"
"15  for we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses,+ but we have one who has been tested in all respects as we have, but without sin.+"
"16  let us, then, approach the throne of undeserved kindness with freeness of speech,+ so that we may receive mercy and find undeserved kindness to help us at the right time."
"6  therefore, now that we have moved beyond the primary doctrine+ about the christ, let us press on to maturity,+ not laying a foundation again, namely, repentance from dead works and faith in god,"
"2  the teaching on baptisms and the laying on of the hands,+ the resurrection of the dead+ and everlasting judgment."
"3  and this we will do, if god indeed permits. "
4  for as regards those who were once enlightened+ and who have tasted the heavenly free gift and who have become partakers of holy spirit
"5  and who have tasted the fine word of god and powers of the coming system of things,*"
"6  but have fallen away,+ it is impossible to revive them again to repentance, because they nail the son of god to the stake again for themselves and expose him to public shame.+"
7  for the ground receives a blessing from god when it drinks in the rain that frequently falls on it and then produces vegetation useful to those for whom it is cultivated.
"8  but if it produces thorns and thistles, it is rejected and is near to being cursed, and in the end it will be burned. "
"9  but in your case, beloved ones, we are convinced of better things, things related to salvation, even though we are speaking in this way."
10  for god is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name+ by ministering and continuing to minister to the holy ones.
"11  but we desire each one of you to show the same industriousness so as to have the full assurance of the hope+ down to the end,+"
"12  so that you may not become sluggish,+ but be imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises. "
"13  for when god made his promise to abraham, since he could not swear by anyone greater, he swore by himself,+"
14  saying: “i will surely bless you and i will surely multiply you.”+
"15  so after abraham had shown patience, he obtained this promise."
"16  for men swear by someone greater, and their oath is the end of every dispute, since it is a legal guarantee to them.+"
"17  in this same way, when god decided to demonstrate more clearly to the heirs of the promise+ the unchangeableness of his purpose,* he guaranteed it* with an oath,"
"18  in order that through two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for god to lie,+ we who have fled to the refuge may have strong encouragement to take firm hold of the hope set before us."
"19  we have this hope+ as an anchor for the soul,* both sure and firm, and it enters in within the curtain,+"
"20  where a forerunner has entered in our behalf, jesus,+ who has become a high priest in the manner of mel·chizʹe·dek forever.+"
"10  for since the law has a shadow+ of the good things to come,+ but not the very substance of the things, it* can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered year after year, make those who approach perfect.+"
"2  otherwise, would not the sacrifices have stopped being offered, because those rendering sacred service once cleansed would have no consciousness of sins anymore?"
"3  on the contrary, these sacrifices are a reminder of sins year after year,+"
4  for it is not possible for the blood of bulls and of goats to take sins away. 
"5  so when he comes into the world, he says: “‘sacrifice and offering you did not want, but you prepared a body for me."
6  you did not approve of whole burnt offerings and sin offerings.’+
"7  then i said: ‘look! i have come (in the scroll* it is written about me) to do your will, o god.’”+"
8  after first saying: “you did not want nor did you approve of sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin offerings”—sacrifices that are offered according to the law—
9  then he says: “look! i have come to do your will.”+ he does away with what is first in order to establish what is second.
10  by this “will”+ we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all time.+ 
"11  also, every priest takes his station day after day to offer holy service*+ and to make the same sacrifices often,+ which can never take sins away completely.+"
"12  but this man offered one sacrifice for sins for all time and sat down at the right hand of god,+"
13  from then on waiting until his enemies should be placed as a stool for his feet.+
14  for it is by one sacrificial offering that he has made those who are being sanctified perfect+ for all time.
"15  moreover, the holy spirit also bears witness to us, for after it has said:"
"16  “‘this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days,’ says jehovah.* ‘i will put my laws in their hearts, and in their minds i will write them.’”+"
17  then it says: “and i will no longer call their sins and their lawless deeds to mind.”+
"18  now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer an offering for sin. "
"19  therefore, brothers, since we have boldness* for the way of entry into the holy place+ by the blood of jesus,"
"20  which he opened up* for us as a new and living way through the curtain,+ that is, his flesh,"
"21  and since we have a great priest over the house of god,+"
"22  let us approach with sincere hearts and complete faith, having had our hearts sprinkled clean from a wicked conscience+ and our bodies bathed with clean water.+"
"23  let us hold firmly the public declaration of our hope without wavering,+ for the one who promised is faithful."
"24  and let us consider* one another so as to incite* to love and fine works,+"
"25  not forsaking our meeting together,+ as some have the custom, but encouraging one another,+ and all the more so as you see the day drawing near.+ "
"26  for if we practice sin willfully after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth,+ there is no longer any sacrifice for sins left,+"
27  but there is a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a burning indignation that is going to consume those in opposition.+
28  anyone who has disregarded the law of moses dies without compassion on the testimony of two or three.+
"29  how much greater punishment do you think a person will deserve who has trampled on the son of god and who has regarded as of ordinary value the blood of the covenant+ by which he was sanctified, and who has outraged the spirit of undeserved kindness with contempt?+"
30  for we know the one who said: “vengeance is mine; i will repay.” and again: “jehovah* will judge his people.”+
31  it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god. 
"32  however, keep remembering the former days in which, after you were enlightened,+ you endured a great struggle along with sufferings."
"33  at times you were publicly exposed* both to reproaches and to tribulations, and at times you shared* with those who were having such an experience."
"34  for you expressed sympathy for those in prison and you accepted joyfully the plundering of your belongings,+ knowing that you yourselves have a better and an enduring possession.+ "
"35  therefore, do not throw away your boldness,* which will be richly rewarded.+"
"36  for you need endurance,+ so that after you have done the will of god, you may receive the fulfillment of the promise."
"37  for yet “a very little while,”+ and “the one who is coming will arrive and will not delay.”+"
"38  “but my righteous one will live by reason of faith,”+ and “if he shrinks back, i have* no pleasure in him.”+"
"39  now we are not the sort who shrink back to destruction,+ but the sort who have faith for the preserving of our lives.*"
"9  for its part, the former covenant used to have legal requirements for sacred service and its holy place+ on earth."
"2  for a first tent compartment was constructed, in which were the lampstand+ and the table and the display of the loaves of presentation;*+ and it is called the holy place.+"
3  but behind the second curtain+ was the tent compartment called the most holy.+
"4  this had a golden censer+ and the ark of the covenant+ completely overlaid with gold,+ in which were the golden jar containing the manna+ and aaron’s rod that budded+ and the tablets+ of the covenant;"
5  and above it were the glorious cherubs overshadowing the propitiatory cover.*+ but now is not the time to speak of these things in detail. 
"6  after these things were constructed this way, the priests enter the first tent compartment regularly to perform the sacred services;+"
"7  but the high priest enters alone into the second compartment once a year,+ not without blood,+ which he offers for himself+ and for the sins that the people+ committed in ignorance."
8  thus the holy spirit makes it clear that the way into the holy place had not yet been revealed while the first tent was standing.+
"9  this tent is an illustration for the present time,+ and according to this arrangement, both gifts and sacrifices are offered.+ however, these are not able to make the conscience of the man doing sacred service perfect.+"
10  they have to do only with foods and drinks and various ceremonial washings.*+ they were legal requirements concerning the body+ and were imposed until the appointed time to set things straight. 
"11  however, when christ came as a high priest of the good things that have already taken place, he passed through the greater and more perfect tent not made with hands, that is, not of this creation."
"12  he entered into the holy place, not with the blood of goats and of young bulls, but with his own blood,+ once for all time, and obtained an everlasting deliverance* for us.+"
"13  for if the blood of goats and of bulls+ and the ashes of a heifer* sprinkled on those who have been defiled sanctifies for the cleansing of the flesh,+"
"14  how much more will the blood of the christ,+ who through an everlasting spirit offered himself without blemish to god, cleanse our consciences from dead works+ so that we may render sacred service to the living god?+ "
"15  that is why he is a mediator of a new covenant,+ in order that because a death has occurred for their release by ransom+ from the transgressions under the former covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the everlasting inheritance.+"
"16  for where there is a covenant, the death of the human covenanter needs to be established,"
"17  because a covenant is valid at death, since it is not in force as long as the human covenanter is living."
"18  consequently, neither was the former covenant put into effect* without blood."
"19  for when moses had spoken every commandment of the law to all the people, he took the blood of the young bulls and of the goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled the book* and all the people,"
20  saying: “this is the blood of the covenant that god has commanded you to keep.”+
21  he likewise sprinkled the tent and all the vessels of the holy service* with the blood.+
"22  yes, according to the law nearly all things are cleansed with blood,+ and unless blood is poured out no forgiveness takes place.+ "
"23  therefore, it was necessary for the typical representations+ of the things in the heavens to be cleansed by these means,+ but the heavenly things require far better sacrifices."
"24  for christ did not enter into a holy place made with hands,+ which is a copy of the reality,+ but into heaven itself,+ so that he now appears before* god on our behalf.+"
"25  this was not done to offer himself often, as when the high priest enters into the holy place from year to year+ with blood that is not his own."
"26  otherwise, he would have to suffer often from the founding of the world. but now he has manifested himself once for all time at the conclusion of the systems of things* to do away with sin through the sacrifice of himself.+"
"27  and just as it is reserved for men to die once for all time, but after this to receive a judgment,"
"28  so also the christ was offered once for all time to bear the sins of many;+ and the second time that he appears it will be apart from sin,* and he will be seen by those earnestly looking for him for their salvation.+"
13  let your brotherly love continue.+
"2  do not forget hospitality,*+ for through it some unknowingly entertained angels.+"
"3  keep in mind those in prison,*+ as though you were imprisoned with them,+ and those being mistreated, since you yourselves also are in the body.*"
"4  let marriage be honorable among all, and let the marriage bed be without defilement,+ for god will judge sexually immoral people* and adulterers.+"
"5  let your way of life be free of the love of money,+ while you are content with the present things.+ for he has said: “i will never leave you, and i will never abandon you.”+"
6  so that we may be of good courage and say: “jehovah* is my helper; i will not be afraid. what can man do to me?”+ 
"7  remember those who are taking the lead among you,+ who have spoken the word of god to you, and as you contemplate how their conduct turns out, imitate their faith.+ "
"8  jesus christ is the same yesterday and today, and forever. "
"9  do not be led astray by various and strange teachings, for it is better for the heart to be strengthened by undeserved kindness than by foods,* which do not benefit those occupied with them.+ "
10  we have an altar from which those who offer sacred service at the tent have no authority to eat.+
11  for the bodies of those animals whose blood is taken into the holy place as a sin offering by the high priest are burned up outside the camp.+
"12  therefore, jesus also suffered outside the city gate+ in order to sanctify the people with his own blood.+"
"13  let us, then, go to him outside the camp, bearing the reproach he bore,+"
"14  for we do not have here a city that remains, but we are earnestly seeking the one to come.+"
"15  through him let us always offer to god a sacrifice of praise,+ that is, the fruit of our lips+ that make public declaration to his name.+"
"16  moreover, do not forget to do good and to share what you have with others,+ for god is well-pleased with such sacrifices.+ "
"17  be obedient to those who are taking the lead among you+ and be submissive,+ for they are keeping watch over you* as those who will render an account,+ so that they may do this with joy and not with sighing, for this would be damaging to you. "
"18  keep praying for us, for we trust we have an honest* conscience, as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.+"
19  but i especially urge you to pray so that i may be restored to you the sooner. 
"20  now may the god of peace, who brought up from the dead the great shepherd+ of the sheep, our lord jesus, with the blood of an everlasting covenant,"
"21  equip you with every good thing to do his will, working in us through jesus christ what is well-pleasing in his sight, to whom be the glory forever and ever. amen. "
"22  now i urge you, brothers, to listen patiently to this word of encouragement, for i have written you a short letter."
"23  i want you to know that our brother timothy has been released. if he comes soon, i will be with him when i see you. "
24  give my greetings to all those who are taking the lead among you and to all the holy ones. those in italy+ send you their greetings. 
25  the undeserved kindness be with all of you.
"5  for every high priest taken from among men is appointed in their behalf over the things relating to god,+ so that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.+"
"2  he is able to deal compassionately* with the ignorant and erring* ones, since he too is confronted with* his own weakness,"
3  and because of that he must make offerings for his own sins just as he does for those of the people.+ 
"4  a man does not take this honor of his own accord, but he receives it only when he is called by god, just as aaron was.+"
"5  so, too, the christ did not glorify himself+ by becoming a high priest, but was glorified by the one who said to him: “you are my son; today i have become your father.”+"
"6  as he also says in another place, “you are a priest forever in the manner of mel·chizʹe·dek.”+ "
"7  during his life on earth,* christ offered up supplications and also petitions, with strong outcries and tears,+ to the one who was able to save him out of death, and he was favorably heard for his godly fear."
"8  although he was a son, he learned obedience from the things he suffered.+"
"9  and after he had been made perfect,+ he became responsible for everlasting salvation to all those obeying him,+"
10  because he has been designated by god a high priest in the manner of mel·chizʹe·dek.+ 
"11  we have much to say about him, and it is difficult to explain, because you have become dull in your hearing."
"12  for although by now* you should be teachers, you again need someone to teach you from the beginning the elementary things+ of the sacred pronouncements of god, and you have gone back to needing milk, not solid food."
"13  for everyone who continues to feed on milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness, for he is a young child.+"
"14  but solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their powers of discernment* trained to distinguish both right and wrong."
"3  not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier* judgment.+"
"2  for we all stumble* many times.+ if anyone does not stumble in word, he is a perfect man, able to bridle also his whole body."
"3  if we put bridles in the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we guide also their whole body."
"4  look also at ships: although they are so big and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the man at the helm is inclined to go. "
"5  so, too, the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it makes great brags. see how small a fire it takes to set a great forest ablaze!"
"6  the tongue is also a fire.+ the tongue represents a world of unrighteousness among our body members, for it defiles all the body+ and sets the whole course of life* on fire, and it is set on fire by ge·henʹna.*"
7  for every kind of wild animal and bird and reptile* and sea creature is to be tamed and has been tamed by humans.
"8  but no human can tame the tongue. it is unruly and injurious, full of deadly poison.+"
"9  with it we praise jehovah,* the father, and yet with it we curse men who have come into existence “in the likeness of god.”+"
"10  out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing. my brothers, it is not right for things to happen this way.+"
"11  a spring does not cause the fresh* water and the bitter water to bubble out of the same opening, does it?"
"12  my brothers, a fig tree cannot produce olives, or a grapevine figs, can it?+ neither can salt water produce fresh water. "
13  who is wise and understanding among you? let him by his fine conduct demonstrate works performed with a mildness that comes from wisdom.
"14  but if you have bitter jealousy+ and contentiousness*+ in your hearts, do not be bragging+ and lying against the truth."
"15  this is not the wisdom that comes down from above; it is earthly,+ animalistic, demonic."
"16  for wherever there are jealousy and contentiousness,* there will also be disorder and every vile thing.+ "
"17  but the wisdom from above is first of all pure,+ then peaceable,+ reasonable,+ ready to obey, full of mercy and good fruits,+ impartial,+ not hypocritical.+"
"18  moreover, the fruit of righteousness is sown in peaceful conditions+ for* those who are making peace.+"
"1  james,+ a slave of god and of the lord jesus christ, to the 12 tribes that are scattered about: greetings! "
"2  consider it all joy, my brothers, when you meet with various trials,+"
3  knowing as you do that this tested quality of your faith produces endurance.+
"4  but let endurance complete its work, so that you may be complete and sound in all respects, not lacking in anything.+ "
"5  so if any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep asking god,+ for he gives generously to all and without reproaching,*+ and it will be given him.+"
"6  but let him keep asking in faith,+ not doubting at all,+ for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and blown about."
"7  in fact, that man should not expect to receive anything from jehovah;*"
"8  he is an indecisive man,+ unsteady in all his ways. "
"9  but let the lowly brother rejoice* over his exaltation,+"
"10  and the rich one over his humiliation,+ because like a flower of the field he will pass away."
"11  for just as the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the plant, and its flower falls off and its outward beauty perishes, so too the rich man will fade away in the midst of his pursuits.+ "
"12  happy is the man who keeps on enduring trial,+ because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life,+ which jehovah* promised to those who continue loving him.+"
"13  when under trial, let no one say: “i am being tried by god.” for with evil things god cannot be tried, nor does he himself try anyone."
14  but each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed* by his own desire.+
"15  then the desire, when it has become fertile,* gives birth to sin; in turn sin, when it has been carried out, brings forth death.+ "
"16  do not be misled, my beloved brothers."
"17  every good gift and every perfect present is from above,+ coming down from the father of the celestial lights,+ who does not vary or change like the shifting shadows.*+"
"18  it was his will to bring us forth by the word of truth,+ so that we would become a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.+ "
"19  know this, my beloved brothers: everyone must be quick to listen, slow to speak,+ slow to anger,+"
20  for man’s anger does not bring about god’s righteousness.+
"21  therefore, put away all filthiness and every trace of badness,*+ and accept with mildness the implanting of the word that is able to save you.* "
"22  however, become doers of the word+ and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves with false reasoning."
"23  for if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer,+ this one is like a man looking at his own face* in a mirror."
"24  for he looks at himself, and he goes away and immediately forgets what sort of person he is."
"25  but the one who peers into the perfect law+ that belongs to freedom and continues in it has become, not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work; and he will be happy in what he does.+ "
"26  if any man thinks he is a worshipper of god* but does not keep a tight rein on* his tongue,+ he is deceiving his own heart, and his worship is futile."
"27  the form of worship* that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our god and father is this: to look after orphans+ and widows+ in their tribulation,+ and to keep oneself without spot from the world.+"
"2  my brothers, you are not holding to the faith of our glorious lord jesus christ while showing favoritism, are you?+"
"2  for if a man with gold rings on his fingers and in splendid clothing comes into your meeting, but a poor man in filthy clothing also enters,"
"3  do you look with favor on the one wearing the splendid clothing and say, “you take this seat here in a fine place,” and do you say to the poor one, “you keep standing” or, “take that seat there under my footstool”?+"
"4  if so, do you not have class distinctions among yourselves,+ and have you not become judges rendering wicked decisions?+ "
"5  listen, my beloved brothers. did not god choose those who are poor from the world’s standpoint to be rich in faith+ and heirs of the kingdom, which he promised to those who love him?+"
6  but you have dishonored the poor. is it not the rich who oppress you+ and drag you before law courts?
7  do they not blaspheme the fine name by which you were called?
"8  if, now, you carry out the royal* law according to the scripture, “you must love your neighbor as yourself,”+ you are doing quite well."
"9  but if you continue showing favoritism,+ you are committing sin, and you are convicted* by the law as transgressors.+ "
"10  for if anyone obeys all the law but makes a false step in one point, he has become an offender against all of it.+"
"11  for the one who said, “you must not commit adultery,”+ also said, “you must not murder.”+ if, now, you do not commit adultery but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of law."
12  keep on speaking and behaving in such a way as those do who are going to be judged by the law of a free people.*+
13  for the one who does not practice mercy will have his judgment without mercy.+ mercy triumphs over judgment. 
"14  of what benefit is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but he does not have works?+ that faith cannot save him, can it?+"
"15  if a brother or a sister is lacking clothing* and enough food for the day,"
"16  yet one of you says to them, “go in peace; keep warm and well fed,” but you do not give them what they need for their body, of what benefit is it?+"
"17  so, too, faith by itself, without works, is dead.+ "
"18  nevertheless, someone will say: “you have faith, and i have works. show me your faith without the works, and i will show you my faith by my works.”"
"19  you believe that there is one god, do you? you are doing quite well. and yet the demons believe and shudder.+"
"20  but do you care to know, o empty man, that faith without works is useless?"
21  was not abraham our father declared righteous by works after he offered up isaac his son on the altar?+
"22  you see that his faith was active along with his works and his faith was perfected by his works,+"
"23  and the scripture was fulfilled that says: “abraham put faith in jehovah,* and it was counted to him as righteousness,”+ and he came to be called jehovah’s* friend.+ "
24  you see that a man is to be declared righteous by works and not by faith alone.
"25  in the same manner, was not raʹhab the prostitute also declared righteous by works after she received the messengers hospitably and sent them out by another way?+"
"26  indeed, just as the body without spirit* is dead,+ so also faith without works is dead.+"
4  what is the source of the wars and fights among you? do they not originate from your fleshly desires that carry on a conflict within you?*+
"2  you desire, and yet you do not have. you go on murdering and coveting, and yet you are not able to obtain. you go on fighting and waging war.+ you do not have because of your not asking."
"3  when you do ask, you do not receive because you are asking for a wrong purpose, so that you may spend it on your fleshly desires. "
"4  adulteresses,* do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with god? whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend of the world is making himself an enemy of god.+"
5  or do you think that for no reason the scripture says: “the spirit that has taken up residence within us keeps enviously longing”?+
"6  however, the undeserved kindness that he gives is greater. so it says: “god opposes the haughty ones,+ but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones.”+ "
"7  therefore, subject yourselves to god;+ but oppose the devil,+ and he will flee from you.+"
"8  draw close to god, and he will draw close to you.+ cleanse your hands, you sinners,+ and purify your hearts,+ you indecisive ones."
"9  give way to misery and mourn and weep.+ let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into despair."
"10  humble yourselves in the eyes of jehovah,*+ and he will exalt you.+ "
"11  stop speaking against one another, brothers.+ whoever speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks against law and judges law. now if you judge law, you are not a doer of law but a judge."
"12  there is only one who is lawgiver and judge,+ the one who is able to save and to destroy.+ but you, who are you to be judging your neighbor?+ "
"13  come, now, you who say: “today or tomorrow we will travel to this city and will spend a year there, and we will do business and make some profit,”+"
14  whereas you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow.+ for you are a mist that appears for a little while and then disappears.+
"15  instead, you should say: “if jehovah* wills,+ we will live and do this or that.”"
16  but now you take pride in your arrogant boasting. all such boasting is wicked.
"17  therefore, if someone knows how to do what is right and yet does not do it, it is a sin for him.+"
"5  come, now, you rich men, weep and wail over the miseries that are coming upon you.+"
"2  your riches have rotted, and your clothing has become moth-eaten.+"
"3  your gold and silver have rusted away, and their rust will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh. what you have stored up will be like a fire in the last days.+"
"4  look! the wages you have withheld from the workers who harvested your fields keep crying out, and the cries for help of the reapers have reached the ears of jehovah* of armies.+"
5  you have lived in luxury and for self-gratification on the earth. you have fattened your hearts on the day of slaughter.+
6  you have condemned; you have murdered the righteous one. is he not opposing you? 
"7  be patient then, brothers, until the presence of the lord.+ look! the farmer keeps waiting for the precious fruit of the earth, exercising patience over it until the early rain and the late rain arrive.+"
"8  you too exercise patience;+ make your hearts firm, because the presence of the lord has drawn close.+ "
"9  do not grumble* against one another, brothers, so that you do not get judged.+ look! the judge is standing before the doors."
"10  brothers, take as a pattern of the suffering of evil+ and the exercising of patience+ the prophets who spoke in the name of jehovah.*+"
"11  look! we consider happy* those who have endured.+ you have heard of the endurance of job+ and have seen the outcome jehovah* gave,+ that jehovah* is very tender in affection* and merciful.+ "
"12  above all, my brothers, stop swearing, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath. but let your “yes” mean yes and your “no,” no,+ so that you do not become liable to judgment. "
13  is there anyone suffering hardship among you? let him carry on prayer.+ is there anyone in good spirits? let him sing psalms.+
"14  is there anyone sick among you? let him call the elders+ of the congregation to him, and let them pray over him, applying oil to him+ in the name of jehovah.*"
"15  and the prayer of faith will make the sick one* well, and jehovah* will raise him up. also, if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. "
"16  therefore, openly confess your sins+ to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. a righteous man’s supplication has a powerful effect.*+"
"17  e·liʹjah was a man with feelings like ours, and yet when he prayed earnestly for it not to rain, it did not rain on the land for three years and six months.+"
"18  then he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain and the land produced fruit.+ "
"19  my brothers, if anyone among you is led astray from the truth and another turns him back,"
20  know that whoever turns a sinner back from the error+ of his way will save him* from death and will cover a multitude of sins.+
"3  in the same way, you wives, be in subjection to your husbands,+ so that if any are not obedient to the word, they may be won without a word through the conduct of their wives,+"
2  because of having been eyewitnesses of your chaste conduct+ together with deep respect.
3  do not let your adornment be external—the braiding of hair and the wearing of gold ornaments+ or fine clothing—
"4  but let it be the secret person of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of the quiet and mild spirit,+ which is of great value in the eyes of god."
"5  for this is how the holy women of the past who hoped in god used to adorn themselves, subjecting themselves to their husbands,"
"6  just as sarah obeyed abraham, calling him lord.+ and you have become her children, provided you continue doing good and do not give in to fear.+ "
"7  you husbands, in the same way, continue dwelling with them according to knowledge.* assign them honor+ as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one, since they are also heirs with you+ of the undeserved favor of life, in order for your prayers not to be hindered. "
"8  finally, all of you have unity of mind,*+ fellow feeling, brotherly affection, tender compassion,+ and humility.+"
"9  do not pay back injury for injury+ or insult for insult.+ instead, repay with a blessing,+ for you were called to this course, so that you might inherit a blessing. "
10  for “whoever would love life and see good days must guard his tongue from bad+ and his lips from speaking deception.
11  let him turn away from what is bad+ and do what is good;+ let him seek peace and pursue it.+
"12  for the eyes of jehovah* are on the righteous, and his ears listen to their supplication,+ but the face of jehovah* is against those doing bad things.”+ "
"13  indeed, who will harm you if you become zealous for what is good?+"
"14  but even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are happy.+ however, do not fear what they fear,* nor be disturbed.+"
"15  but sanctify the christ as lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense before everyone who demands of you a reason for the hope you have, but doing so with a mild temper+ and deep respect.+ "
"16  maintain a good conscience,+ so that in whatever way you are spoken against, those who speak against you may be put to shame+ because of your good conduct as followers of christ.+"
"17  for it is better to suffer because you are doing good,+ if it is god’s will to allow it, than because you are doing evil.+"
"18  for christ died once for all time for sins,+ a righteous person for unrighteous ones,+ in order to lead you to god.+ he was put to death in the flesh+ but made alive in the spirit.+"
"19  and in this state he went and preached to the spirits in prison,+"
"20  who had formerly been disobedient when god was patiently waiting* in noah’s day,+ while the ark was being constructed,+ in which a few people, that is, eight souls,* were carried safely through the water.+ "
"21  baptism, which corresponds to this, is also now saving you (not by the removing of the filth of the flesh, but by the request to god for a good conscience),+ through the resurrection of jesus christ."
"22  he is at god’s right hand,+ for he went to heaven, and angels and authorities and powers were made subject to him.+"
"1  peter, an apostle+ of jesus christ, to the temporary residents scattered about in ponʹtus, ga·laʹti·a, cap·pa·doʹci·a,+ asia, and bi·thynʹi·a, to those chosen"
"2  according to the foreknowledge of god the father,+ with sanctification by the spirit,+ for the purpose of being obedient and sprinkled with the blood of jesus christ:+ may undeserved kindness and peace be increased to you. "
"3  praised be the god and father of our lord jesus christ, for according to his great mercy he gave us a new birth+ to a living hope+ through the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead,+"
"4  to an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance.+ it is reserved in the heavens for you,+"
5  who are being safeguarded by god’s power through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last period of time.
"6  because of this you are greatly rejoicing, though for a short time, if it must be, you have been distressed by various trials,+"
"7  in order that the tested quality of your faith,+ of much greater value than gold that perishes despite its being tested* by fire, may be found a cause for praise and glory and honor at the revelation of jesus christ.+"
"8  though you never saw him, you love him. though you do not see him now, yet you exercise faith in him and are greatly rejoicing with an indescribable and glorious joy,"
"9  as you attain the goal of your faith, your salvation.*+ "
"10  concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the undeserved kindness meant for you made a diligent inquiry and a careful search.+"
11  they kept on investigating what particular time or what season the spirit within them was indicating concerning christ+ as it testified beforehand about the sufferings meant for christ+ and about the glory that would follow.
"12  it was revealed to them that they were ministering, not to themselves, but to you, regarding what has now been announced to you by those who declared the good news to you with holy spirit sent from heaven.+ into these very things, angels are desiring to peer. "
13  so brace up your minds for activity;+ keep your senses completely;+ set your hope on the undeserved kindness that will be brought to you at the revelation of jesus christ.
"14  as obedient children, stop being molded by* the desires you formerly had in your ignorance,"
"15  but like the holy one who called you, become holy yourselves in all your conduct,+"
"16  for it is written: “you must be holy, because i am holy.”+ "
"17  and if you are calling on the father who judges impartially+ according to each one’s work, conduct yourselves with fear+ during the time of your temporary residence."
"18  for you know that it was not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, that you were set free*+ from your futile way of life handed down to you by your forefathers.*"
"19  but it was with precious blood,+ like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb,+ that of christ.+"
"20  true, he was foreknown before the founding of the world,+ but he was made manifest at the end of the times for your sake.+"
"21  through him you are believers in god,+ the one who raised him up from the dead+ and gave him glory,+ so that your faith and hope might be in god. "
"22  now that you have purified yourselves* by your obedience to the truth with unhypocritical brotherly affection+ as the result, love one another intensely from the heart.+"
"23  for you have been given a new birth,+ not by corruptible, but by incorruptible seed,*+ through the word of the living and enduring god.+"
"24  for “all flesh is* like grass, and all its glory is like a blossom of the field; the grass withers, and the flower falls off,"
25  but the saying* of jehovah* endures forever.”+ and this “saying”* is the good news that was declared to you.+
2  so rid yourselves of all badness+ and deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all backbiting.
"2  as newborn infants,+ form a longing for the unadulterated* milk of the word, so that by means of it you may grow to salvation,+"
3  provided you have tasted* that the lord is kind. 
"4  as you come to him, a living stone rejected by men+ but chosen, precious to god,+"
"5  you yourselves as living stones are being built up into a spiritual house+ to be a holy priesthood, in order to offer up spiritual sacrifices+ acceptable to god through jesus christ.+"
"6  for it says in scripture: “look! i am laying in zion a chosen stone, a precious foundation cornerstone, and no one exercising faith in it will ever be disappointed.”*+ "
"7  it is to you, therefore, that he is precious, because you are believers; but to those not believing, “the stone that the builders rejected,+ this has become the chief cornerstone”*+"
8  and “a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense.”+ they are stumbling because they are disobedient to the word. to this very end they were appointed.
"9  but you are “a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation,+ a people for special possession,+ that you should declare abroad the excellencies”*+ of the one who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.+"
"10  for you were once not a people, but now you are god’s people;+ once you had not been shown mercy, but now you have received mercy.+ "
"11  beloved, i urge you as foreigners and temporary residents+ to keep abstaining from fleshly desires,+ which wage war against you.*+"
"12  maintain your conduct fine among the nations,+ so that when they accuse you of being wrongdoers, they may be eyewitnesses of your fine works+ and, as a result, glorify god in the day of his inspection. "
"13  for the lord’s sake subject yourselves to every human creation,*+ whether to a king+ as being superior"
14  or to governors as sent by him to punish wrongdoers but to praise those who do good.+
15  for it is the will of god that by doing good you may silence* the ignorant talk of unreasonable men.+
"16  be as free people,+ using your freedom, not as a cover* for doing wrong,+ but as slaves of god.+"
"17  honor men of all sorts,+ have love for the whole association of brothers,*+ be in fear of god,+ honor the king.+ "
"18  let servants be in subjection to their masters with all due fear,+ not only to the good and reasonable but also to those hard to please."
19  for it is agreeable when someone endures hardship* and suffers unjustly because of conscience toward god.+
"20  for what merit is there if you are beaten for sinning and you endure it?+ but if you endure suffering because of doing good, this is an agreeable thing to god.+ "
"21  in fact, to this course you were called, because even christ suffered for you,+ leaving a model for you to follow his steps closely.+"
"22  he committed no sin,+ nor was deception found in his mouth.+"
"23  when he was being insulted,*+ he did not insult* in return.+ when he was suffering,+ he did not threaten, but he entrusted himself to the one who judges+ righteously."
"24  he himself bore our sins+ in his own body on the stake,*+ so that we might die to* sins and live to righteousness. and “by his wounds you were healed.”+"
"25  for you were like sheep going astray,+ but now you have returned to the shepherd+ and overseer of your souls.*"
"4  since christ suffered in the flesh,+ you too arm yourselves with the same mental disposition;* because the person who has suffered in the flesh has desisted from sins,+"
"2  so that he may live the remainder of his time in the flesh, no more for the desires of men,+ but for god’s will.+"
"3  for the time that has passed by is sufficient for you to have done the will of the nations+ when you carried on in acts of brazen conduct,* unbridled passions, overdrinking, wild parties,* drinking bouts, and lawless idolatries.+"
"4  they are puzzled that you do not continue running with them in the same decadent course of debauchery, so they speak abusively of you.+"
5  but these people will render an account to the one who is ready to judge those living and those dead.+
"6  in fact, this is why the good news was declared also to the dead,+ so that although they are judged in the flesh from the standpoint of men, they might live in harmony with the spirit from god’s standpoint. "
"7  but the end of all things has drawn close. therefore, be sound in mind,+ and be vigilant* with a view to prayers.+"
"8  above all things, have intense love for one another,+ because love covers a multitude of sins.+"
9  be hospitable to one another without grumbling.+
"10  to the extent that each one has received a gift, use it in ministering to one another as fine stewards of god’s undeserved kindness that is expressed in various ways.+"
"11  if anyone speaks, let him do so as speaking pronouncements from god; if anyone ministers, let him do so as depending on the strength that god supplies;+ so that in all things god may be glorified+ through jesus christ. the glory and the might are his forever and ever. amen. "
"12  beloved ones, do not be surprised about the fiery trials that you are experiencing,+ as though something strange were happening to you."
"13  on the contrary, go on rejoicing+ over the extent to which you are sharers in the sufferings of the christ,+ so that you may rejoice and be overjoyed also during the revelation of his glory.+"
"14  if you are being reproached* for the name of christ, you are happy,+ because the spirit of glory, yes, the spirit of god, is resting upon you. "
"15  however, let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or a wrongdoer or a busybody in other people’s matters.+"
"16  but if anyone suffers as a christian, let him not feel ashamed,+ but let him keep on glorifying god while bearing this name."
"17  for it is the appointed time for the judgment to start with the house of god.+ now if it starts first with us,+ what will the outcome be for those who are not obedient to the good news of god?+"
"18  “and if the righteous man is being saved with difficulty, what will happen to the ungodly man and the sinner?”+"
"19  so, then, let those who are suffering in harmony with the will of god keep on entrusting* themselves* to a faithful creator while they are doing good.+"
"5  therefore, as a fellow elder, a witness of the sufferings of the christ and a sharer of the glory that is to be revealed,+ i make this appeal* to the elders among you:"
"2  shepherd the flock of god+ under your care, serving as overseers,* not under compulsion, but willingly before god;+ not for love of dishonest gain,+ but eagerly;"
"3  not lording it over those who are god’s inheritance,+ but becoming examples to the flock.+"
"4  and when the chief shepherd+ has been made manifest, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.+ "
"5  in the same way, you younger men, be in subjection to the older men.*+ but all of you clothe* yourselves with humility* toward one another, because god opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones.+ "
"6  humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of god, so that he may exalt you in due time,+"
"7  while you throw all your anxiety* on him,+ because he cares for you.+"
"8  keep your senses, be watchful!+ your adversary, the devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone.*+"
"9  but take your stand against him,+ firm in the faith, knowing that the same kind of sufferings are being experienced by the entire association of your brothers* in the world.+"
"10  but after you have suffered a little while, the god of all undeserved kindness, who called you to his everlasting glory+ in union with christ, will himself finish your training. he will make you firm,+ he will make you strong,+ he will firmly ground you."
11  to him be the might forever. amen. 
"12  through sil·vaʹnus,*+ whom i regard as a faithful brother, i have written you in few words in order to encourage you and to give an earnest witness that this is the true undeserved kindness of god. stand firm in it."
"13  she who is in babylon, a chosen one like you, sends you her greetings, and so does mark,+ my son."
14  greet one another with a kiss of love. may all of you who are in union with christ have peace.
"3  beloved ones, this is now the second letter i am writing you in which, as in my first one, i am stirring up your clear thinking faculties by way of a reminder,+"
2  that you should remember the sayings previously spoken* by the holy prophets and the commandment of the lord and savior through your apostles.
"3  first of all know this, that in the last days ridiculers will come with their ridicule, proceeding according to their own desires+"
"4  and saying: “where is this promised presence of his?+ why, from the day our forefathers fell asleep in death, all things are continuing exactly as they were from creation’s beginning.”+ "
"5  for they deliberately ignore this fact, that long ago there were heavens and an earth standing firmly out of water and in the midst of water by the word of god;+"
6  and that by those means the world of that time suffered destruction when it was flooded with water.+
7  but by the same word the heavens and the earth that now exist are reserved for fire and are being kept until the day of judgment and of destruction of the ungodly people.+ 
"8  however, do not let this escape your notice, beloved ones, that one day is with jehovah* as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day.+"
"9  jehovah* is not slow concerning his promise,+ as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with you because he does not desire anyone to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.+"
"10  but jehovah’s* day+ will come as a thief,+ in which the heavens will pass away+ with a roar,* but the elements being intensely hot will be dissolved, and earth and the works in it will be exposed.+ "
"11  since all these things are to be dissolved in this way, consider what sort of people you ought to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion,"
"12  as you await and keep close in mind* the presence of the day of jehovah,*+ through which the heavens will be destroyed+ in flames and the elements will melt in the intense heat!"
"13  but there are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise,+ and in these righteousness is to dwell.+ "
"14  therefore, beloved ones, since you are awaiting these things, do your utmost to be found finally by him spotless and unblemished and in peace.+"
"15  furthermore, consider the patience of our lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother paul also wrote you according to the wisdom given him,+"
"16  speaking about these things as he does in all his letters. however, some things in them are hard to understand, and these things the ignorant* and unstable are twisting, as they do also the rest of the scriptures, to their own destruction. "
"17  you, therefore, beloved ones, having this advance knowledge, be on your guard so that you may not be led astray with them by the error of the lawless people and fall from your own steadfastness.*+"
"18  no, but go on growing in the undeserved kindness and knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ. to him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. amen."
"1  simon peter, a slave and an apostle of jesus christ, to those who have acquired a faith as precious as ours* through the righteousness of our god and the savior jesus christ: "
"2  may undeserved kindness and peace be increased to you by an accurate knowledge+ of god and of jesus our lord,"
3  for his divine power has granted* us all the things that contribute to life and godly devotion through the accurate knowledge of the one who called us+ by his own glory and virtue.
"4  through these things he has granted* us the precious and very grand promises,+ so that through these you may become sharers in divine nature,+ having escaped from the world’s corruption produced by wrong desire.* "
"5  for this very reason, put forth all earnest effort+ to supply to your faith virtue,+ to your virtue knowledge,+"
"6  to your knowledge self-control, to your self-control+ endurance, to your endurance godly devotion,+"
"7  to your godly devotion brotherly affection, to your brotherly affection love.+"
"8  for if these things exist in you and overflow, they will prevent you from being either inactive or unfruitful*+ regarding the accurate knowledge of our lord jesus christ. "
"9  for anyone lacking these things is blind, shutting his eyes to the light,*+ and has become forgetful of his cleansing from his sins+ of long ago."
"10  therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to make your calling+ and choosing sure for yourselves, for if you keep on doing these things, you will by no means ever fail.+"
"11  in fact, in this way you will be richly granted* entrance into the everlasting kingdom+ of our lord and savior jesus christ.+ "
"12  for this reason i intend always to remind you of these things, although you know them and are well-established in the truth that is present in you."
"13  but i consider it right, as long as i am in this tabernacle,*+ to stir you with reminders,+"
"14  knowing as i do that my tabernacle is soon to be removed, just as also our lord jesus christ made clear to me.+"
"15  i will always do my utmost so that after my departure, you may be able to recall* these things for yourselves. "
"16  no, it was not by following artfully contrived false stories that we made known to you the power and presence of our lord jesus christ, but rather, we were eyewitnesses of his magnificence.+"
"17  for he received from god the father honor and glory when words such as these* were conveyed to him by the magnificent glory: “this is my son, my beloved, whom i myself have approved.”+"
"18  yes, these words we heard coming from heaven while we were with him in the holy mountain. "
"19  so we have the prophetic word made more sure, and you are doing well in paying attention to it as to a lamp+ shining in a dark place (until day dawns and a daystar+ rises) in your hearts."
"20  for you know this first, that no prophecy of scripture springs from any private interpretation."
"21  for prophecy was at no time brought by man’s will,+ but men spoke from god as they were moved* by holy spirit.+"
"2  however, there also came to be false prophets among the people, as there will also be false teachers among you.+ these will quietly bring in destructive sects, and they will even disown the owner who bought them,+ bringing speedy destruction upon themselves."
"2  furthermore, many will follow their brazen conduct,*+ and because of them the way of the truth will be spoken of abusively.+"
"3  also, they will greedily exploit you with counterfeit words. but their judgment, decided long ago,+ is not moving slowly, and their destruction is not sleeping.+ "
"4  certainly god did not refrain from punishing the angels who sinned,+ but threw them into tarʹta·rus,*+ putting them in chains* of dense darkness to be reserved for judgment.+"
"5  and he did not refrain from punishing an ancient world,+ but kept noah, a preacher of righteousness,+ safe with seven others+ when he brought a flood upon a world of ungodly people.+"
"6  and by reducing the cities of sodʹom and go·morʹrah to ashes, he condemned them,+ setting a pattern for ungodly people of things to come.+"
"7  and he rescued righteous lot,+ who was greatly distressed by the brazen conduct* of the lawless people—"
8  for day after day that righteous man was tormenting his righteous soul* over the lawless deeds that he saw and heard while dwelling among them.
"9  so, then, jehovah* knows how to rescue people of godly devotion out of trial,+ but to reserve unrighteous people to be destroyed* on the day of judgment,+"
"10  especially those who seek to defile the flesh of others+ and who despise authority.*+ daring and self-willed, they are not afraid to speak abusively of glorious ones,"
"11  whereas angels, although they are greater in strength and power, do not bring against them an accusation in abusive terms, out of respect for* jehovah.*+"
"12  but these men, like unreasoning animals that act on instinct and are born* to be caught and destroyed, speak abusively about things of which they are ignorant.+ they will suffer destruction brought on by their own destructive course,"
"13  suffering harm as their reward for their own harmful course. they consider it pleasurable to indulge in luxurious living,+ even in the daytime. they are spots and blemishes who revel* in their deceptive teachings while feasting together with you.+"
"14  their eyes are full of adultery+ and are unable to desist from sin, and they entice unstable ones.* they have a heart trained in greed. they are accursed children."
"15  abandoning the straight path, they have been led astray. they have followed the path of baʹlaam+ the son of beʹor, who loved the reward of wrongdoing,+"
16  but was reproved for his own violation of what was right.+ a voiceless beast of burden speaking with a human voice hindered the prophet’s mad course.+ 
"17  these are waterless springs and mists driven by a violent storm, and the blackest darkness has been reserved for them.+"
"18  they make high-sounding statements that are empty. by appealing to the desires of the flesh+ and with acts of brazen conduct,* they entice people who have just escaped from those who live in error.+"
"19  while they are promising them freedom, they themselves are slaves of corruption;+ for if anyone is overcome by someone, he is his slave.*+"
"20  certainly if after escaping from the defilements of the world+ by an accurate knowledge of the lord and savior jesus christ, they get involved again with these very things and are overcome, their final state has become worse for them than the first.+"
21  it would have been better for them not to have accurately known the path of righteousness than after knowing it to turn away from the holy commandment they had received.+
"22  what the true proverb says has happened to them: “the dog has returned to its own vomit, and the sow that was bathed to rolling in the mire.”+"
"3  see what sort of love the father has given us,+ that we should be called children of god!+ and that is what we are. that is why the world does not know us,+ because it has not come to know him.+"
"2  beloved ones, we are now children of god,+ but it has not yet been made manifest what we will be.+ we do know that when he is made manifest we will be like him, because we will see him just as he is."
"3  and everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself,+ just as that one is pure. "
"4  everyone who practices sin is also practicing lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness."
"5  you know, too, that he was made manifest to take away our sins,+ and there is no sin in him."
6  everyone remaining in union with him does not practice sin;+ no one who practices sin has either seen him or come to know him.
"7  little children, let no one mislead you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as that one is righteous."
"8  the one who practices sin originates with the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning.*+ for this purpose the son of god was made manifest, to break up* the works of the devil.+ "
"9  everyone who has been born from god does not practice sin,+ for his seed* remains in such one, and he cannot practice sin, for he has been born from god.+"
"10  the children of god and the children of the devil are evident by this fact: whoever does not practice righteousness does not originate with god, nor does the one who does not love his brother.+"
"11  for this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another;+"
"12  not like cain, who originated with the wicked one and slaughtered his brother.+ and for what reason did he slaughter him? because his own works were wicked,+ but those of his brother were righteous.+ "
"13  do not be surprised, brothers, that the world hates you.+"
"14  we know that we have passed over from death to life,+ because we love the brothers.+ the one who does not love remains in death.+"
"15  everyone who hates his brother is a murderer,*+ and you know that no murderer has everlasting life remaining in him.+"
"16  by this we have come to know love, because that one surrendered his life* for us,+ and we are under obligation to surrender our lives* for our brothers.+"
"17  but whoever has the material possessions of this world and sees his brother in need and yet refuses to show him compassion, in what way does the love of god remain in him?+"
"18  little children, we should love, not in word or with the tongue,+ but in deed+ and truth.+ "
"19  by this we will know that we originate with the truth, and we will assure* our hearts before him"
"20  regarding whatever our hearts may condemn us in, because god is greater than our hearts and knows all things.+"
"21  beloved ones, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have freeness of speech toward god;+"
"22  and whatever we ask we receive from him,+ because we are observing his commandments and doing what is pleasing in his eyes."
"23  indeed, this is his commandment: that we have faith in the name of his son jesus christ+ and love one another,+ just as he gave us a commandment."
"24  moreover, the one who observes his commandments remains in union with him, and he in union with such one.+ and by the spirit that he gave us, we know that he remains in union with us.+"
"1  that which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have observed and our hands have felt, concerning the word of life,+"
"2  (yes, the life was made manifest, and we have seen and are bearing witness+ and reporting to you the everlasting life+ that was with the father and was made manifest to us),"
"3  that which we have seen and heard we are reporting also to you,+ so that you too may have fellowship* with us. and this fellowship of ours is with the father and with his son jesus christ.+"
4  and we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete. 
"5  this is the message that we heard from him and are announcing to you: god is light,+ and there is no darkness at all in him.*"
"6  if we make the statement, “we are having fellowship with him,” and yet we go on walking in the darkness, we are lying and are not practicing the truth.+"
"7  however, if we are walking in the light as he himself is in the light, we do have fellowship with one another, and the blood of jesus his son cleanses us from all sin.+ "
"8  if we make the statement, “we have no sin,” we are misleading ourselves+ and the truth is not in us."
"9  if we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous so as to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.+"
"10  if we make the statement, “we have not sinned,” we are making him a liar, and his word is not in us."
"2  my little children, i am writing you these things so that you may not commit a sin. and yet, if anyone does commit a sin, we have a helper* with the father, jesus christ,+ a righteous one.+"
"2  and he is a propitiatory sacrifice*+ for our sins,+ yet not for ours only but also for the whole world’s.+"
"3  and by this we realize that we have come to know him, namely, if we continue observing his commandments."
"4  the one who says, “i have come to know him,” and yet does not observe his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in this person."
"5  but whoever does observe his word, in this person the love of god has truly been made perfect.+ by this we know that we are in union with him.+"
6  the one who says he remains in union with him is himself under obligation to go on walking just as that one walked.+ 
"7  beloved ones, i am writing you, not a new commandment, but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning.+ this old commandment is the word that you heard."
"8  again, i am writing you a new commandment, which is true in his case and in yours, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.+ "
9  the one who says that he is in the light and yet hates+ his brother is still in the darkness.+
"10  the one who loves his brother remains in the light,+ and in him there is no cause for stumbling."
"11  but the one who hates his brother is in the darkness and is walking in the darkness,+ and he does not know where he is going,+ because the darkness has blinded his eyes. "
"12  i am writing you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you for the sake of his name.+"
"13  i am writing you, fathers, because you have come to know him who is from the beginning. i am writing you, young men, because you have conquered the wicked one.+ i write you, young children, because you have come to know the father.+"
"14  i write you, fathers, because you have come to know him who is from the beginning. i write you, young men, because you are strong+ and the word of god remains in you+ and you have conquered the wicked one.+ "
"15  do not love either the world or the things in the world.+ if anyone loves the world, the love of the father is not in him;+"
"16  because everything in the world—the desire of the flesh+ and the desire of the eyes+ and the showy display of one’s means of life*—does not originate with the father, but originates with the world."
"17  furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire,+ but the one who does the will of god remains forever.+ "
"18  young children, it is the last hour, and just as you have heard that the antichrist is coming,+ even now many antichrists have appeared,+ from which fact we know that it is the last hour."
"19  they went out from us, but they were not of our sort;*+ for if they had been of our sort, they would have remained with us. but they went out so that it might be shown that not all are of our sort.+"
"20  and you have an anointing from the holy one,+ and all of you have knowledge."
"21  i write you, not because you do not know the truth,+ but because you know it, and because no lie originates with the truth.+ "
"22  who is the liar but the one who denies that jesus is the christ?+ this is the antichrist,+ the one who denies the father and the son."
23  everyone who denies the son does not have the father either.+ but whoever acknowledges the son+ has the father also.+
"24  as for you, what you have heard from the beginning must remain in you.+ if what you have heard from the beginning remains in you, you will also remain in union with the son and in union with the father."
"25  furthermore, this is what he himself promised us—the life everlasting.+ "
26  i write you these things about those who are trying to mislead you.
"27  and as for you, the anointing that you received from him+ remains in you, and you do not need anyone to be teaching you; but the anointing from him is teaching you about all things+ and is true and is no lie. just as it has taught you, remain in union with him.+"
"28  so now, little children, remain in union with him, so that when he is made manifest we may have freeness of speech+ and not shrink away from him in shame at his presence."
"29  if you know that he is righteous, you also know that everyone who practices righteousness has been born from him.+"
"4  beloved ones, do not believe every inspired statement,*+ but test the inspired statements* to see whether they originate with god,+ for many false prophets have gone out into the world.+ "
2  this is how you know that the inspired statement is from god: every inspired statement that acknowledges jesus christ as having come in the flesh originates with god.+
"3  but every inspired statement that does not acknowledge jesus does not originate with god.+ furthermore, this is the antichrist’s inspired statement that you have heard was coming,+ and now it is already in the world.+ "
"4  you originate with god, little children, and you have conquered them,+ because the one who is in union with you+ is greater than the one who is in union with the world.+"
5  they originate with the world;+ that is why they speak what originates with the world and the world listens to them.+
6  we originate with god. whoever comes to know god listens to us;+ whoever does not originate with god does not listen to us.+ by this we distinguish the inspired statement of truth from the inspired statement of error.+ 
"7  beloved ones, let us continue loving one another,+ because love is from god, and everyone who loves has been born from god and knows god.+"
"8  whoever does not love has not come to know god, because god is love.+"
"9  by this the love of god was revealed in our case, that god sent his only-begotten son+ into the world so that we might gain life through him.+"
"10  the love is in this respect, not that we have loved god, but that he loved us and sent his son as a propitiatory sacrifice*+ for our sins.+ "
"11  beloved ones, if this is how god loved us, then we are also under obligation to love one another.+"
"12  no one has seen god at any time.+ if we continue loving one another, god remains in us and his love is made perfect in us.+"
"13  by this we know that we are remaining in union with him and he in union with us, because he has given his spirit to us."
"14  in addition, we ourselves have seen and are bearing witness that the father has sent his son as savior of the world.+"
"15  whoever acknowledges that jesus is god’s son,+ god remains in union with such one and he in union with god.+"
"16  and we have come to know and believe the love that god has for us.+ god is love,+ and the one who remains in love remains in union with god and god remains in union with him.+"
"17  in this way love has been made perfect in us, so that we may have freeness of speech*+ in the day of judgment, because just as that one is, so are we ourselves in this world."
"18  there is no fear in love,+ but perfect love casts* fear out, because fear restrains us. indeed, the one who is fearful has not been made perfect in love.+"
"19  we love, because he first loved us.+ "
"20  if anyone says, “i love god,” and yet is hating his brother, he is a liar.+ for the one who does not love his brother,+ whom he has seen, cannot love god, whom he has not seen.+"
"21  and we have this commandment from him, that whoever loves god must also love his brother.+"
"5  everyone who believes that jesus is the christ has been born from god,+ and everyone who loves the one who caused to be born loves him who has been born from that one."
"2  by this we know that we love the children of god,+ when we love god and carry out his commandments."
"3  for this is what the love of god means, that we observe his commandments;+ and yet his commandments are not burdensome,+"
"4  because everyone who* has been born from god conquers the world.+ and this is the conquest that has conquered the world, our faith.+ "
5  who can conquer the world?+ is it not the one who has faith that jesus is the son of god?+
"6  this is the one who came by means of water and blood, jesus christ, not with the water only,+ but with the water and with the blood.+ and the spirit is bearing witness,+ because the spirit is the truth."
7  for there are three witness bearers:
8  the spirit+ and the water+ and the blood;+ and the three are in agreement. 
"9  if we accept the witness of men, the witness of god is greater. because this is the witness god gives, the witness that he has given about his son."
"10  the person putting his faith in the son of god has the witness within himself. the person not having faith in god has made him a liar,+ because he has not put his faith in the witness given by god concerning his son."
"11  and this is the witness, that god gave us everlasting life,+ and this life is in his son.+"
12  the one who has the son has this life; the one who does not have the son of god does not have this life.+ 
"13  i write you these things so that you may know that you have life everlasting,+ you who put your faith in the name of the son of god.+"
"14  and this is the confidence* that we have toward him,+ that no matter what we ask according to his will, he hears us.+"
"15  and if we know that he hears us concerning whatever we are asking, we know that we are to have the things we ask for, since we have asked them of him.+ "
"16  if anyone catches sight of his brother committing a sin that does not incur death, he will ask, and god will give life to him,+ yes, to those not committing sin that incurs death. there is a sin that does incur death.+ it is concerning that sin that i do not tell him to make request."
"17  all unrighteousness is sin,+ and yet there is a sin that does not incur death. "
"18  we know that everyone who has been born from god does not practice sin, but the one born from god* watches him, and the wicked one cannot take hold of him.*+"
"19  we know that we originate with god, but the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.+"
"20  but we know that the son of god has come,+ and he has given us insight* so that we may gain the knowledge of the one who is true. and we are in union with the one who is true,+ by means of his son jesus christ. this is the true god and life everlasting.+"
"21  little children, guard yourselves from idols.+"
"1  the older man* to the chosen lady and to her children, whom i truly love, and not only i but also all those who have come to know the truth,"
2  because of the truth that remains in us and will be with us forever.
"3  there will be with us undeserved kindness, mercy, and peace from god the father and from jesus christ, the son of the father, with truth and love. "
"4  i rejoice very much because i have found some of your children walking in the truth,+ just as we received commandment from the father."
"5  so now i request you, lady, that we love one another. (i am writing you, not a new commandment, but one that we had from the beginning.)+"
"6  and this is what love means, that we go on walking according to his commandments.+ this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you should go on walking in it."
"7  for many deceivers have gone out into the world,+ those not acknowledging jesus christ as coming in the flesh.+ this is the deceiver and the antichrist.+ "
"8  look out for yourselves, so that you do not lose the things we have worked to produce, but that you may obtain a full reward.+"
9  everyone who pushes ahead and does not remain in the teaching of the christ does not have god.+ the one who does remain in this teaching is the one who has both the father and the son.+
"10  if anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your homes+ or say a greeting to him."
11  for the one who says a greeting to him is a sharer in his wicked works. 
"12  although i have many things to write to you, i do not want to do so with paper and ink, but i am hoping to come to you and to speak with you face-to-face, so that your joy may be in full measure. "
"13  the children of your sister, the chosen one, send you their greetings."
"1  the older man* to gaʹius, the beloved, whom i truly love. "
"2  beloved one, i pray that in all things you continue to prosper and enjoy good health, just as you are* now prospering."
"3  for i rejoiced very much when brothers came and bore witness about the truth you hold, as you go on walking in the truth.+"
4  no greater joy* do i have than this: that i should hear that my children go on walking in the truth.+ 
"5  beloved one, you show your faithfulness in what you do for the brothers, even though they are strangers to you.+"
6  they have given a witness about your love before the congregation. please send them on their way in a manner worthy of god.+
"7  for it was in behalf of his name that they went out, not taking anything+ from the people of the nations."
"8  so we are under obligation to show hospitality to such ones,+ so that we may become fellow workers in the truth.+ "
"9  i wrote something to the congregation, but di·otʹre·phes, who likes to have the first place among them,+ does not accept anything from us with respect.+"
"10  that is why if i come, i will call attention to the works he is doing in spreading malicious talk about us.*+ not being content with this, he refuses to welcome the brothers+ with respect; and those who want to welcome them, he tries to hinder and to throw out of the congregation. "
"11  beloved one, do not imitate what is bad, but imitate what is good.+ the one who does good originates with god.+ the one who does bad has not seen god.+"
"12  de·meʹtri·us has been well-reported-on by them all and by the truth itself. in fact, we too are bearing witness about him, and you know that the witness we give is true. "
"13  i had many things to write you, but i do not wish to go on writing you with pen and ink."
"14  however, i am hoping to see you soon, and we will speak face-to-face. may you have peace. the friends send you their greetings. give my greetings to the friends by name."
"1  jude, a slave of jesus christ, but a brother of james,+ to the called ones+ who are loved by god the father and preserved for jesus christ:+ "
2  may mercy and peace and love be increased to you. 
"3  beloved ones, although i was making every effort to write you about the salvation we hold in common,+ i found it necessary to write you to urge you to put up a hard fight for the faith+ that was once for all time delivered to the holy ones."
"4  my reason is that certain men have slipped in among you who were long ago appointed to this judgment by the scriptures; they are ungodly men who turn the undeserved kindness of our god into an excuse for brazen conduct*+ and who prove false to our only owner* and lord, jesus christ.+ "
"5  although you are fully aware of all of this, i want to remind you that jehovah,* having saved a people out of the land of egypt,+ afterward destroyed those not showing faith.+"
"6  and the angels who did not keep their original position but forsook their own proper dwelling place,+ he has reserved with eternal bonds in dense darkness for the judgment of the great day.+"
"7  in the same manner, sodʹom and go·morʹrah and the cities around them also gave themselves over to gross sexual immorality* and pursued unnatural fleshly desires;+ they are placed before us as a warning example by undergoing the judicial punishment of everlasting fire.+ "
"8  despite this, these men too are indulging in dreams, defiling the flesh, despising authority, and speaking abusively of glorious ones.+"
"9  but when miʹcha·el+ the archangel+ had a difference with the devil and was disputing about moses’ body,+ he did not dare to bring a judgment against him in abusive terms,+ but said: “may jehovah* rebuke you.”+"
"10  but these men are speaking abusively about all the things they really do not understand.+ and in all the things that they do understand by instinct like unreasoning animals,+ they go on corrupting themselves. "
"11  too bad for them, for they have followed the path of cain+ and have rushed into the erroneous course of baʹlaam+ for reward, and they have perished in the rebellious talk+ of korʹah!+"
"12  these are the rocks hidden below water at your love feasts+ while they feast with you, shepherds who feed themselves without fear;+ waterless clouds carried here and there by the wind;+ fruitless trees in late autumn, having died twice* and having been uprooted;"
"13  wild waves of the sea that cast up the foam of their own shame;+ stars with no set course, for which the blackest darkness stands reserved forever.+ "
"14  yes, the seventh one in line from adam, eʹnoch,+ also prophesied about them when he said: “look! jehovah* came with his holy myriads*+"
"15  to execute judgment against all,+ and to convict all the ungodly concerning all their ungodly deeds that they did in an ungodly way, and concerning all the shocking things that ungodly sinners spoke against him.”+ "
"16  these men are murmurers,+ complainers about their lot in life, following their own desires,+ and their mouths make grandiose boasts, while they are flattering others* for their own benefit.+ "
"17  as for you, beloved ones, call to mind the sayings that have been previously spoken* by the apostles of our lord jesus christ,"
"18  how they used to say to you: “in the last time there will be ridiculers, following their own desires for ungodly things.”+"
"19  these are the ones who cause divisions,+ animalistic men,* not having spirituality.*"
"20  but you, beloved ones, build yourselves up on your most holy faith, and pray with holy spirit,+"
"21  in order to keep yourselves in god’s love,+ while you await the mercy of our lord jesus christ with everlasting life in view.+"
"22  also, continue showing mercy+ to some who have doubts;+"
"23  save them+ by snatching them out of the fire. but continue showing mercy to others, doing so with fear, while you hate even the garment that has been stained by the flesh.+ "
"24  now to the one who is able to guard you from stumbling and to make you stand unblemished+ in the sight of his glory* with great joy,"
"25  to the only god our savior through jesus christ our lord, be glory, majesty, might, and authority for all past eternity and now and into all eternity. amen."
"17  one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls+ came and said to me: “come, i will show you the judgment on the great prostitute who sits on many waters,+"
"2  with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality,*+ and earth’s inhabitants were made drunk with the wine of her sexual immorality.”*+ "
3  and he carried me away in the power of the spirit into a wilderness. and i saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored wild beast that was full of blasphemous names and that had seven heads and ten horns.
"4  the woman was clothed in purple+ and scarlet, and she was adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls,+ and she had in her hand a golden cup that was full of disgusting things and the unclean things of her sexual immorality.*"
"5  on her forehead was written a name, a mystery: “babylon the great, the mother of the prostitutes+ and of the disgusting things of the earth.”+"
"6  and i saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the holy ones and with the blood of the witnesses of jesus.+ well, on seeing her i was greatly amazed."
7  so the angel said to me: “why is it that you were amazed? i will tell you the mystery of the woman+ and of the wild beast that is carrying her and that has the seven heads and the ten horns:+
"8  the wild beast that you saw was, but is not, and yet is about to ascend out of the abyss,+ and it is to go off into destruction. and the inhabitants of the earth—those whose names have not been written in the scroll of life+ from the founding of the world—will be amazed when they see how the wild beast was, but is not, and yet will be present. "
"9  “this calls for a mind* that has wisdom: the seven heads+ mean seven mountains, where the woman sits on top."
"10  and there are seven kings: five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet arrived; but when he does arrive, he must remain a short while."
"11  and the wild beast that was but is not,+ it is also an eighth king, but it springs from the seven, and it goes off into destruction. "
"12  “the ten horns that you saw mean ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they do receive authority as kings for one hour with the wild beast."
"13  these have one thought, so they give their power and authority to the wild beast."
"14  these will battle with the lamb,+ but because he is lord of lords and king of kings,+ the lamb will conquer them.+ also, those with him who are called and chosen and faithful will do so.”+ "
"15  he said to me: “the waters that you saw, where the prostitute is sitting, mean peoples and crowds and nations and tongues.*+"
"16  and the ten horns+ that you saw and the wild beast,+ these will hate the prostitute+ and will make her devastated and naked, and they will eat up her flesh and completely burn her with fire.+"
"17  for god put it into their hearts to carry out his thought,+ yes, to carry out their one thought by giving their kingdom to the wild beast,+ until the words of god will have been accomplished."
18  and the woman+ whom you saw means the great city that has a kingdom over the kings of the earth.”
"18  after this i saw another angel descending from heaven with great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his glory."
"2  and he cried out with a strong voice, saying: “she has fallen! babylon the great has fallen,+ and she has become a dwelling place of demons and a place where every unclean spirit* and every unclean and hated bird lurks!+"
"3  for because of the wine of the passion* of her sexual immorality,* all the nations have fallen victim,+ and the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her,+ and the merchants* of the earth became rich owing to the power of her shameless luxury.” "
"4  and i heard another voice out of heaven say: “get out of her, my people,+ if you do not want to share with her in her sins, and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.+"
"5  for her sins have massed together clear up to heaven,+ and god has called her acts of injustice* to mind.+"
"6  repay her in the way she treated others,+ yes, pay her back double for the things she has done;+ in the cup+ she has mixed, mix a double portion for her.+"
"7  to the extent that she glorified herself and lived in shameless luxury, to that extent give her torment and mourning. for she keeps saying in her heart: ‘i sit as queen, and i am not a widow, and i will never see mourning.’+"
"8  that is why in one day her plagues will come, death and mourning and famine, and she will be completely burned with fire,+ because jehovah* god, who judged her, is strong.+ "
9  “and the kings of the earth who committed sexual immorality* with her and lived with her in shameless luxury will weep and beat themselves in grief over her when they see the smoke from her burning.
"10  they will stand at a distance because of their fear of her torment and say: ‘too bad, too bad, you great city,+ babylon you strong city, because in one hour your judgment has arrived!’ "
"11  “also, the merchants of the earth are weeping and mourning over her, because there is no one to buy their full cargo anymore,"
"12  a full cargo of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, and scarlet cloth; and everything made from scented wood; and every sort of object made from ivory, and from precious wood, copper, iron, and marble;"
"13  also cinnamon, indian spice, incense, perfumed oil, frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, carriages, slaves, and human lives.*"
"14  yes, the fine fruit that you* desired has left you, and all the delicacies and the splendid things have vanished from you, never to be found again. "
"15  “the merchants who sold these things, who became rich from her, will stand at a distance because of their fear of her torment and will weep and mourn,"
"16  saying: ‘too bad, too bad, the great city, clothed with fine linen, purple, and scarlet and richly adorned with gold ornaments, precious stones, and pearls,+"
17  because in one hour such great riches have been devastated!’ “and every ship captain and every seafaring person and sailors and all those who make a living by the sea stood at a distance
18  and cried out as they looked at the smoke from her burning and said: ‘what city is like the great city?’
"19  they threw dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and mourning, and said: ‘too bad, too bad, the great city, in which all those who had ships at sea became rich from her wealth, because in one hour she has been devastated!’+ "
"20  “be glad over her, o heaven,+ also you holy ones+ and apostles and prophets, because god has pronounced his judgment on her in your behalf!”+ "
"21  and a strong angel lifted up a stone like a great millstone and hurled it into the sea, saying: “thus with a swift pitch will babylon the great city be hurled down, and she will never be found again.+"
"22  and the sound of singers who accompany themselves on the harp, of musicians, of flutists, and of trumpeters will never be heard in you again. and no craftsman who practices any trade will ever be found in you again, and no sound of a millstone will ever be heard in you again."
"23  no light of a lamp will ever shine in you again, and no voice of a bridegroom and of a bride will ever be heard in you again; for your merchants were the top-ranking men of the earth, and by your spiritistic practices+ all the nations were misled."
"24  yes, in her was found the blood of prophets and of holy ones+ and of all those who have been slaughtered on the earth.”+"
"19  after this i heard what seemed to be a loud voice of a great crowd in heaven. they said: “praise jah!*+ the salvation and the glory and the power belong to our god,"
"2  because his judgments are true and righteous.+ for he has executed judgment on the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality,* and he has avenged the blood of his slaves that is on her hands.”*+"
3  and right away for the second time they said: “praise jah!*+ and the smoke from her goes on ascending forever and ever.”+ 
4  and the 24 elders+ and the four living creatures+ fell down and worshipped god who sits on the throne and said: “amen! praise jah!”*+ 
"5  also, a voice came from the throne and said: “be praising our god, all you his slaves,+ who fear him, the small ones and the great.”+ "
"6  and i heard what sounded like a voice of a great crowd and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of heavy thunders. they said: “praise jah,*+ because jehovah* our god, the almighty,+ has begun to rule as king!+"
"7  let us rejoice and be overjoyed and give him glory, because the marriage of the lamb has arrived and his wife has prepared herself."
"8  yes, it has been granted to her to be clothed with bright, clean, fine linen—for the fine linen stands for the righteous acts of the holy ones.”+ "
"9  and he tells me, “write: happy are those invited to the evening meal of the lamb’s marriage.”+ also, he tells me: “these are the true sayings of god.”"
10  at that i fell down before his feet to worship him. but he tells me: “be careful! do not do that!+ i am only a fellow slave of you and of your brothers who have the work of witnessing concerning jesus.+ worship god!+ for the witness concerning jesus is what inspires prophecy.”+ 
"11  i saw heaven opened, and look! a white horse.+ and the one seated on it is called faithful+ and true,+ and he judges and carries on war in righteousness.+"
"12  his eyes are a fiery flame,+ and on his head are many diadems.* he has a name written that no one knows but he himself,"
"13  and he is clothed with an outer garment stained* with blood, and he is called by the name the word+ of god."
"14  also, the armies in heaven were following him on white horses, and they were clothed in white, clean, fine linen."
"15  and out of his mouth protrudes a sharp, long sword+ with which to strike the nations, and he will shepherd them with a rod of iron.+ moreover, he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of god the almighty.+"
"16  on his outer garment, yes, on his thigh, he has a name written, king of kings and lord of lords.+ "
"17  i saw also an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice and said to all the birds that fly in midheaven:* “come here, be gathered together to the great evening meal of god,+"
"18  so that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of military commanders and the flesh of strong men+ and the flesh of horses and of those seated on them,+ and the flesh of all, of freemen as well as of slaves and of small ones and great.” "
19  and i saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the one seated on the horse and against his army.+
"20  and the wild beast was caught, and along with it the false prophet+ that performed in front of it the signs with which he misled those who received the mark of the wild beast+ and those who worship its image.+ while still alive, they both were hurled into the fiery lake that burns with sulfur.+"
21  but the rest were killed off with the long sword that proceeded out of the mouth of the one seated on the horse.+ and all the birds were filled with their flesh.+
20  and i saw an angel coming down out of heaven with the key of the abyss+ and a great chain in his hand.
"2  he seized the dragon,+ the original serpent,+ who is the devil+ and satan,+ and bound him for 1,000 years."
"3  and he hurled him into the abyss+ and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would not mislead the nations anymore until the 1,000 years were ended. after this he must be released for a little while.+ "
"4  and i saw thrones, and those who sat on them were given authority to judge. yes, i saw the souls* of those executed* for the witness they gave about jesus and for speaking about god, and those who had not worshipped the wild beast or its image and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand.+ and they came to life and ruled as kings with the christ+ for 1,000 years."
"5  (the rest of the dead+ did not come to life until the 1,000 years were ended.) this is the first resurrection.+"
"6  happy and holy is anyone having part in the first resurrection;+ over these the second death+ has no authority,+ but they will be priests+ of god and of the christ, and they will rule as kings with him for the 1,000 years.+ "
"7  now as soon as the 1,000 years have ended, satan will be released from his prison,"
"8  and he will go out to mislead those nations in the four corners of the earth, gog and maʹgog, to gather them together for the war. the number of these is as the sand of the sea."
9  and they advanced over the whole earth and encircled the camp of the holy ones and the beloved city. but fire came down out of heaven and consumed them.+
"10  and the devil who was misleading them was hurled into the lake of fire and sulfur, where both the wild beast+ and the false prophet already were;+ and they will be tormented* day and night forever and ever. "
"11  and i saw a great white throne and the one seated on it.+ from before him the earth and the heaven fled away,+ and no place was found for them."
"12  and i saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and scrolls were opened. but another scroll was opened; it is the scroll of life.+ the dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds.+"
"13  and the sea gave up the dead in it, and death and the grave* gave up the dead in them, and they were judged individually according to their deeds.+"
"14  and death and the grave* were hurled into the lake of fire.+ this means the second death,+ the lake of fire.+"
"15  furthermore, whoever was not found written in the book of life+ was hurled into the lake of fire.+"
"3  “to the angel of the congregation in sarʹdis write: these are the things that he says who has the seven spirits of god+ and the seven stars:+ ‘i know your deeds, that you have the name* that you are alive, but you are dead.+"
"2  become watchful,+ and strengthen the things remaining that were ready to die, for i have not found your works fully performed* before my god."
"3  therefore, continue mindful of* how you have received and how you heard, and go on keeping it, and repent.+ certainly unless you wake up, i will come as a thief,+ and you will not know at all at what hour i will come upon you.+ "
"4  “‘nevertheless, you do have a few individuals* in sarʹdis who did not defile their garments,+ and they will walk with me in white ones,+ because they are worthy."
"5  the one who conquers+ will thus be dressed in white garments,+ and i will by no means blot out* his name from the book of life,+ but i will acknowledge his name before my father and before his angels.+"
6  let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations.’ 
"7  “to the angel of the congregation in philadelphia write: these are the things he says who is holy,+ who is true,+ who has the key of david,+ who opens so that no one will shut and shuts so that no one opens:"
"8  ‘i know your deeds—look! i have set before you an opened door,+ which no one can shut. and i know that you have a little power, and you kept my word and did not prove false to my name."
"9  look! i will make those from the synagogue of satan who say they are jews yet are not,+ but are lying—look! i will make them come and bow* before your feet and make them know that i have loved you."
"10  because you kept the word about my endurance,*+ i will also keep you from the hour of test,+ which is to come upon the entire inhabited earth, to put to the test those dwelling on the earth."
"11  i am coming quickly.+ keep holding fast to what you have, so that no one may take your crown.+ "
"12  “‘the one who conquers—i will make him a pillar in the temple of my god, and he will by no means go out from it anymore, and i will write upon him the name of my god+ and the name of the city of my god, the new jerusalem+ that descends out of heaven from my god, and my own new name.+"

"14  “to the angel of the congregation in la·o·di·ceʹa+ write: these are the things that the amen+ says, the faithful and true+ witness,+ the beginning of the creation by god:+"
"15  ‘i know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. i wish you were cold or else hot."
"16  so because you are lukewarm and neither hot+ nor cold,+ i am going to vomit you out of my mouth."
"17  because you say, “i am rich+ and have acquired riches and do not need anything at all,” but you do not know that you are miserable and pitiful and poor and blind and naked,"
"18  i advise you to buy from me gold refined by fire so that you may become rich, and white garments so that you may become dressed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be exposed,+ and eyesalve to rub in your eyes+ so that you may see.+ "
"19  “‘all those for whom i have affection, i reprove and discipline.+ so be zealous and repent.+"

22  let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations.’”
"7  after this i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding tight the four winds of the earth, so that no wind could blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree."
"2  and i saw another angel ascending from the sunrise,* having a seal of the living god; and he called with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea,"
"3  saying: “do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees, until after we have sealed+ the slaves of our god in their foreheads.”+ "
"4  and i heard the number of those who were sealed, 144,000,+ sealed out of every tribe of the sons of israel:+ "
"5  out of the tribe of judah 12,000 sealed;out of the tribe of reuʹben 12,000;out of the tribe of gad 12,000;"
"6  out of the tribe of ashʹer 12,000;out of the tribe of naphʹta·li 12,000;out of the tribe of ma·nasʹseh+ 12,000;"
"7  out of the tribe of simʹe·on 12,000;out of the tribe of leʹvi 12,000;out of the tribe of isʹsa·char 12,000;"
"8  out of the tribe of zebʹu·lun 12,000;out of the tribe of joseph 12,000;out of the tribe of benjamin 12,000 sealed. "
"9  after this i saw, and look! a great crowd, which no man was able to number, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues,*+ standing before the throne and before the lamb, dressed in white robes;+ and there were palm branches in their hands.+"
"10  and they keep shouting with a loud voice, saying: “salvation we owe to our god, who is seated on the throne,+ and to the lamb.”+ "
"11  all the angels were standing around the throne and the elders+ and the four living creatures, and they fell facedown before the throne and worshipped god,"
12  saying: “amen! let the praise and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honor and the power and the strength be to our god forever and ever.+ amen.” 
"13  in response one of the elders said to me: “these who are dressed in the white robes,+ who are they and where did they come from?”"
"14  so right away i said to him: “my lord, you are the one who knows.” and he said to me: “these are the ones who come out of the great tribulation,+ and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb.+"
"15  that is why they are before the throne of god, and they are rendering him sacred service day and night in his temple; and the one seated on the throne+ will spread his tent over them.+"
"16  they will hunger no more nor thirst anymore, neither will the sun beat down on them nor any scorching heat,+"
"17  because the lamb,+ who is in the midst* of the throne, will shepherd them+ and will guide them to springs* of waters of life.+ and god will wipe out every tear from their eyes.”+"
"12  then a great sign was seen in heaven: a woman+ was arrayed* with the sun, and the moon was beneath her feet, and on her head was a crown of 12 stars,"
2  and she was pregnant. and she was crying out in her pains and in her agony to give birth. 
"3  another sign was seen in heaven. look! a great fiery-colored dragon,+ with seven heads and ten horns and on its heads seven diadems;*"
"4  and its tail drags a third of the stars+ of heaven, and it hurled them down to the earth.+ and the dragon kept standing before the woman+ who was about to give birth, so that when she did give birth, it might devour her child. "
"5  and she gave birth to a son,+ a male, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod.+ and her child was snatched* away to god and to his throne."
"6  and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by god and where they would feed her for 1,260 days.+ "
"7  and war broke out in heaven: miʹcha·el*+ and his angels battled with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels battled"
"8  but they did not prevail,* nor was a place found for them any longer in heaven."
"9  so down the great dragon+ was hurled, the original serpent,+ the one called devil+ and satan,+ who is misleading the entire inhabited earth;+ he was hurled down to the earth,+ and his angels were hurled down with him."
"10  i heard a loud voice in heaven say: “now have come to pass the salvation+ and the power and the kingdom of our god+ and the authority of his christ, because the accuser of our brothers has been hurled down, who accuses them day and night before our god!+"
"11  and they conquered him+ because of the blood of the lamb+ and because of the word of their witnessing,+ and they did not love their souls*+ even in the face of death."
"12  on this account be glad, you heavens and you who reside in them! woe for the earth and for the sea,+ because the devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing that he has a short period of time.”+ "
"13  now when the dragon saw that it had been hurled down to the earth,+ it persecuted the woman+ who gave birth to the male child."
"14  but the two wings of the great eagle+ were given to the woman, so that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is to be fed for a time and times and half a time*+ away from the face of the serpent.+ "
"15  and the serpent spewed out water like a river from its mouth after the woman, to cause her to be drowned by the river."
"16  but the earth came to the woman’s help, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragon spewed out from its mouth."
"17  so the dragon became enraged at the woman and went off to wage war with the remaining ones of her offspring,*+ who observe the commandments of god and have the work of bearing witness concerning jesus.+"
"1  a revelation* by jesus christ, which god gave him,+ to show his slaves+ the things that must shortly take place. and he sent his angel and presented it in signs through him to his slave john,+"
"2  who bore witness to the word god gave and to the witness jesus christ gave, yes, to all the things he saw."
"3  happy is the one who reads aloud and those who hear the words of this prophecy and who observe the things written in it,+ for the appointed time is near. "
"4  john to the seven congregations+ that are in the province of asia: may you have undeserved kindness and peace from “the one who is and who was and who is coming,”+ and from the seven spirits+ that are before his throne,"
"5  and from jesus christ, “the faithful witness,”+ “the firstborn from the dead,”+ and “the ruler of the kings of the earth.”+ to him who loves us+ and who set us free from our sins by means of his own blood+—"
"6  and he made us to be a kingdom,+ priests+ to his god and father—yes, to him be the glory and the might forever. amen. "
"7  look! he is coming with the clouds,+ and every eye will see him, and those who pierced him; and all the tribes of the earth will beat themselves in grief because of him.+ yes, amen. "
"8  “i am the alʹpha and the o·meʹga,”*+ says jehovah* god, “the one who is and who was and who is coming, the almighty.”+ "
"9  i john, your brother and a sharer with you in the tribulation+ and kingdom+ and endurance+ in association with jesus,+ was on the island called patʹmos for speaking about god and bearing witness concerning jesus."
"10  by inspiration i came to be in the lord’s day, and i heard behind me a strong voice like that of a trumpet,"
"11  saying: “what you see, write in a scroll and send it to the seven congregations: in ephʹe·sus,+ in smyrʹna,+ in perʹga·mum,+ in thy·a·tiʹra,+ in sarʹdis,+ in philadelphia,+ and in la·o·di·ceʹa.”+ "
"12  i turned to see who was speaking with me, and when i turned, i saw seven golden lampstands,+"
"13  and in the midst of the lampstands someone like a son of man,+ clothed in a garment that reached down to the feet and wearing a golden sash around his chest."
"14  moreover, his head and his hair were white as white wool, as snow, and his eyes were like a fiery flame,+"
"15  and his feet were like fine copper+ when glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many waters."
"16  and he had in his right hand seven stars,+ and out of his mouth a sharp, long, two-edged sword+ was protruding, and his countenance* was like the sun when it shines at its brightest.+"
"17  when i saw him, i fell as dead at his feet. and he laid his right hand on me and said: “do not be afraid. i am the first+ and the last,+"
"18  and the living one,+ and i became dead,+ but look! i am living forever and ever,+ and i have the keys of death and of the grave.*+"
"19  so write down the things you saw, and the things that are, and the things that will take place after these."
"20  as for the sacred secret of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars mean the angels of the seven congregations, and the seven lampstands mean the seven congregations.+"
"8  when he+ opened the seventh seal,+ there was silence in heaven for about half an hour."
"2  and i saw the seven angels+ who stand before god, and seven trumpets were given to them. "
"3  another angel, holding a golden incense vessel,* arrived and stood at the altar,+ and a large quantity of incense+ was given him to offer it with the prayers of all the holy ones on the golden altar+ that was before the throne."
4  the smoke of the incense from the hand of the angel ascended with the prayers+ of the holy ones before god.
"5  but right away the angel took the incense vessel, and he filled it with some of the fire of the altar and hurled it to the earth. and there were thunders and voices and flashes of lightning+ and an earthquake."
6  and the seven angels with the seven trumpets+ prepared to blow them. 
"7  the first one blew his trumpet. and there was hail and fire mingled with blood, and it was hurled to the earth;+ and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green vegetation was burned up.+ "
8  the second angel blew his trumpet. and something like a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the sea.+ and a third of the sea became blood;+
"9  and a third of the living creatures* in the sea died,+ and a third of the ships were wrecked. "
"10  the third angel blew his trumpet. and a great star burning like a lamp fell from heaven, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs* of waters.+"
"11  the name of the star is wormwood. and a third of the waters turned into wormwood, and many of the people died from the waters, because these had been made bitter.+ "
"12  the fourth angel blew his trumpet. and a third of the sun was struck+ and a third of the moon and a third of the stars, in order that a third of them might be darkened+ and the day might not have light for a third of it, and the night likewise. "
"13  and i saw, and i heard an eagle flying in midheaven say with a loud voice: “woe, woe, woe+ to those dwelling on the earth because of the rest of the trumpet blasts of the three angels who are about to blow their trumpets!”+"
11  and a reed like a rod*+ was given to me as he said: “get up and measure the temple sanctuary of god and the altar and those worshipping in it.
"2  but as for the courtyard that is outside the temple sanctuary, leave it out and do not measure it, because it has been given to the nations, and they will trample the holy city+ underfoot for 42 months.+"
"3  i will cause my two witnesses to prophesy for 1,260 days dressed in sackcloth.”"
4  these are symbolized by the two olive trees+ and the two lampstands+ and are standing before the lord of the earth.+ 
"5  if anyone wants to harm them, fire comes out of their mouths and consumes their enemies. if anyone should want to harm them, this is how he must be killed."
"6  these have the authority to shut up the sky*+ so that no rain may fall+ during the days of their prophesying, and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood+ and to strike the earth with every sort of plague as often as they wish. "
"7  when they have finished their witnessing, the wild beast that ascends out of the abyss will wage war with them and conquer them and kill them.+"
"8  and their corpses will be on the main street of the great city that is in a spiritual sense called sodʹom and egypt, where their lord was also executed on the stake."
"9  and those of the peoples and tribes and tongues* and nations will look at their corpses for three and a half days,+ and they do not allow their corpses to be laid in a tomb."
"10  and those dwelling on the earth rejoice over them and celebrate, and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those dwelling on the earth. "
"11  after the three and a half days, spirit of life from god entered into them,+ and they stood on their feet, and great fear fell upon those who saw them."
"12  and they heard a loud voice from heaven say to them: “come up here.” and they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies saw them.*"
"13  in that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; and 7,000 persons were killed by the earthquake, and the rest became frightened and gave glory to the god of heaven. "
14  the second woe+ is past. look! the third woe is coming quickly. 
"15  the seventh angel blew his trumpet.+ and there were loud voices in heaven, saying: “the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our lord+ and of his christ,+ and he will rule as king forever and ever.”+ "
"16  and the 24 elders+ who were seated before god on their thrones fell upon their faces and worshipped god,"
"17  saying: “we thank you, jehovah* god, the almighty, the one who is+ and who was, because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king.+"
"18  but the nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the appointed time came for the dead to be judged and to reward+ your slaves the prophets+ and the holy ones and those fearing your name, the small and the great, and to bring to ruin those ruining* the earth.”+ "
"19  and the temple sanctuary of god in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple sanctuary.+ and there were flashes of lightning and voices and thunders and an earthquake and a great hail."
2  “to the angel+ of the congregation in ephʹe·sus+ write: these are the things that he says who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands:+
"2  ‘i know your deeds, and your labor and endurance, and that you cannot tolerate bad men, and that you put to the test those who say they are apostles,+ but they are not, and you found them to be liars."
"3  you are also showing endurance, and you have persevered for the sake of my name+ and have not grown weary.+"
"4  nevertheless, i hold this against you, that you have left the love you had at first. "
"5  “‘therefore remember from where you have fallen, and repent+ and do the deeds you did at first. if you do not, i will come to you, and i will remove your lampstand+ from its place, unless you repent.+"
"6  still, you do have this in your favor: that you hate the deeds of the sect of nic·o·laʹus,+ which i also hate."
"7  let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations:+ to the one who conquers+ i will grant to eat of the tree of life,+ which is in the paradise of god.’ "
"8  “and to the angel of the congregation in smyrʹna write: these are the things that he says, ‘the first and the last,’+ who became dead and came to life again:+"
"9  ‘i know your tribulation and poverty—but you are rich+—and the blasphemy by those who call themselves jews and really are not, but they are a synagogue of satan.+"
"10  do not be afraid of the things you are about to suffer.+ look! the devil will keep on throwing some of you into prison so that you may be fully put to the test, and you will have tribulation for ten days. prove yourself faithful even to death, and i will give you the crown of life.+"
11  let the one who has an ear hear+ what the spirit says to the congregations: the one who conquers+ will by no means be harmed by the second death.’+ 
"12  “to the angel of the congregation in perʹga·mum write: these are the things that he says who has the sharp, long, two-edged sword:+"
"13  ‘i know where you are dwelling, that is, where the throne of satan is; and yet you keep holding fast to my name,+ and you did not deny your faith in me+ even in the days of anʹti·pas, my faithful witness,+ who was killed+ by your side, where satan is dwelling. "
"14  “‘nevertheless, i have a few things against you, that you have there those adhering to the teaching of baʹlaam,+ who taught baʹlak+ to put a stumbling block before the sons of israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit sexual immorality.*+"
"15  in the same way, you also have those adhering to the teaching of the sect of nic·o·laʹus.+"
"16  so repent. if you do not, i am coming to you quickly, and i will war against them with the long sword of my mouth.+ "
"17  “‘let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations:+ to the one who conquers+ i will give some of the hidden manna,+ and i will give him a white pebble, and written on the pebble is a new name that no one knows except the one receiving it.’ "
"18  “to the angel of the congregation in thy·a·tiʹra+ write: these are the things that the son of god says, the one who has eyes like a fiery flame+ and whose feet are like fine copper:+"
"19  ‘i know your deeds, and your love and faith and ministry and endurance, and that your deeds of late are more than those you did at first. "
"20  “‘nevertheless, i do hold this against you, that you tolerate that woman jezʹe·bel,+ who calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches and misleads my slaves to commit sexual immorality*+ and to eat things sacrificed to idols."
"21  and i gave her time to repent, but she is not willing to repent of her sexual immorality.*"
"22  look! i am about to throw her into a sickbed, and those committing adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of her deeds."
"23  and i will kill her children with deadly plague, so that all the congregations will know that i am the one who searches the innermost thoughts* and hearts, and i will give to you individually according to your deeds.+ "
"24  “‘however, i say to the rest of you who are in thy·a·tiʹra, all those who do not follow this teaching, those who did not get to know the so-called “deep things of satan”:+ i am not putting on you any other burden."
"25  just the same, hold fast to what you have until i come.+"
"26  and to the one who conquers and observes my deeds down to the end, i will give authority over the nations,+"
"27  and he will shepherd the people with an iron rod+ so that they will be broken to pieces like clay vessels, just as i have received from my father."
28  and i will give him the morning star.+
29  let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations.’
"4  after this i saw, and look! an opened door in heaven, and the first voice that i heard speaking with me was like a trumpet, saying: “come up here, and i will show you the things that must take place.”"
"2  after this i immediately came to be in the power of the spirit, and look! a throne was in its position in heaven, and someone was seated on the throne.+"
"3  and the one seated had the appearance of a jasper stone+ and a sardius stone,* and all around the throne was a rainbow like an emerald in appearance.+ "
"4  all around the throne were 24 thrones, and on these thrones i saw seated 24 elders+ dressed in white garments, and on their heads golden crowns."
"5  from the throne were coming lightning+ and voices and thunders;+ and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, and these mean the seven spirits of god.+"
"6  before the throne was something resembling a glassy sea,+ like crystal. in the midst of the throne* and around the throne were four living creatures+ that were full of eyes in front and behind."
"7  the first living creature was like a lion,+ and the second living creature was like a young bull,+ and the third living creature+ had a face like a man’s, and the fourth living creature+ was like a flying eagle.+"
"8  as for the four living creatures, each one of them had six wings; they were full of eyes all around and underneath.+ and continuously, day and night, they say: “holy, holy, holy is jehovah*+ god, the almighty, who was and who is and who is coming.”+ "
"9  whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanksgiving to the one seated on the throne, the one who lives forever and ever,+"
"10  the 24 elders+ fall down before the one seated on the throne and worship the one who lives forever and ever, and they cast their crowns before the throne, saying:"
"11  “you are worthy, jehovah* our god, to receive the glory+ and the honor+ and the power,+ because you created all things,+ and because of your will they came into existence and were created.”"
16  and i heard a loud voice out of the sanctuary+ say to the seven angels: “go and pour out the seven bowls of the anger of god on the earth.”+ 
2  the first one went off and poured out his bowl on the earth.+ and a hurtful and malignant ulcer+ afflicted the people who had the mark of the wild beast+ and who were worshipping its image.+ 
"3  the second one poured out his bowl into the sea.+ and it became blood+ like that of a dead man, and every living creature* died, yes, the things in the sea.+ "
4  the third one poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs* of water.+ and they became blood.+
"5  i heard the angel over the waters say: “you, the one who is and who was,+ the loyal one,+ are righteous, for you have issued these judgments,+"
"6  because they poured out the blood of holy ones and of prophets,+ and you have given them blood to drink;+ they deserve it.”+"
"7  and i heard the altar say: “yes, jehovah* god, the almighty,+ true and righteous are your judgments.”*+ "
"8  the fourth one poured out his bowl on the sun,+ and to the sun it was granted to scorch the people with fire."
"9  and the people were scorched by the great heat, but they blasphemed the name of god, who has the authority over these plagues, and they did not repent and give glory to him. "
"10  the fifth one poured out his bowl on the throne of the wild beast. and its kingdom became darkened,+ and they began to gnaw their tongues because of their pain,"
"11  but they blasphemed the god of heaven because of their pains and their ulcers, and they did not repent of their works. "
"12  the sixth one poured out his bowl on the great river eu·phraʹtes,+ and its water was dried up+ to prepare the way for the kings+ from the rising of the sun.* "
13  and i saw three unclean inspired expressions* that looked like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon+ and out of the mouth of the wild beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
"14  they are, in fact, expressions inspired by demons and they perform signs,+ and they go out to the kings of the entire inhabited earth, to gather them together to the war+ of the great day of god the almighty.+ "
"15  “look! i am coming as a thief.+ happy is the one who stays awake+ and keeps his outer garments, so that he may not walk naked and people look upon his shamefulness.”+ "
16  and they gathered them together to the place that is called in hebrew armageddon.*+ 
"17  the seventh one poured out his bowl on the air. at this a loud voice came out of the sanctuary+ from the throne, saying: “it has come to pass!”"
"18  and there were flashes of lightning and voices and thunders, and there was a great earthquake unlike any that had occurred since men came to be on the earth,+ so extensive and so great was the earthquake."
"19  the great city+ split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell; and babylon the great+ was remembered before god, to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath.+"
"20  also, every island fled, and mountains were not found.+"
"21  then great hailstones, each about the weight of a talent,* fell from heaven on the people,+ and the people blasphemed god because of the plague of hail,+ for the plague was unusually great."
"6  and i saw when the lamb+ opened one of the seven seals,+ and i heard one of the four living creatures+ say with a voice like thunder: “come!”"
"2  and i saw, and look! a white horse,+ and the one seated on it had a bow; and a crown was given him,+ and he went out conquering and to complete his conquest.+ "
"3  when he opened the second seal, i heard the second living creature+ say: “come!”"
"4  another came out, a fiery-colored horse, and it was granted to the one seated on it to take peace away from the earth so that they should slaughter one another, and he was given a great sword.+ "
"5  when he opened the third seal,+ i heard the third living creature+ say: “come!” and i saw, and look! a black horse, and the one seated on it had a pair of scales in his hand."
6  i heard what sounded like a voice in the midst of the four living creatures say: “a quart* of wheat for a de·narʹi·us*+ and three quarts of barley for a de·narʹi·us; and do not harm the olive oil and the wine.”+ 
"7  when he opened the fourth seal, i heard the voice of the fourth living creature+ say: “come!”"
"8  and i saw, and look! a pale horse, and the one seated on it had the name death. and the grave* was closely following him. and authority was given them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with a long sword and with food shortage+ and with deadly plague and by the wild beasts of the earth.+ "
"9  when he opened the fifth seal, i saw underneath the altar+ the souls*+ of those slaughtered because of the word of god and because of the witness they had given.+"
"10  they shouted with a loud voice, saying: “until when, sovereign lord, holy and true,+ are you refraining from judging and avenging our blood on those who dwell on the earth?”+"
"11  and a white robe was given to each of them,+ and they were told to rest a little while longer, until the number was filled of their fellow slaves and their brothers who were about to be killed as they had been.+ "
"12  and i saw when he opened the sixth seal, and a great earthquake occurred; and the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair,* and the entire moon became as blood,+"
13  and the stars of heaven fell to the earth as when a fig tree shaken by a high wind drops its unripe figs.
"14  and the heaven departed as a scroll that is being rolled up,+ and every mountain and every island was removed from its place.+"
"15  then the kings of the earth, the high officials, the military commanders, the rich, the strong, every slave, and every free person hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains.+"
"16  and they keep saying to the mountains and to the rocks: “fall over us+ and hide us from the face of the one seated on the throne+ and from the wrath of the lamb,+"
"17  because the great day of their wrath has come,+ and who is able to stand?”+"
"10  and i saw another strong angel descending from heaven, arrayed* with a cloud, and a rainbow was on his head, and his face was like the sun,+ and his legs* were like pillars of fire,"
"2  and he had in his hand a little scroll that had been unrolled. and he set his right foot on the sea, but his left one on the earth,"
"3  and he cried out with a loud voice just as when a lion roars.+ and when he cried out, the voices of the seven thunders+ spoke. "
"4  now when the seven thunders spoke, i was about to write, but i heard a voice out of heaven+ say: “seal up the things the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them down.”"
"5  the angel whom i saw standing on the sea and on the earth raised his right hand to heaven,"
"6  and he swore by the one who lives forever and ever,+ who created the heaven and the things in it and the earth and the things in it and the sea and the things in it:+ “there will be no delay any longer."
"7  but in the days when the seventh angel+ is about to blow his trumpet,+ the sacred secret+ that god declared as good news to his own slaves the prophets+ is indeed brought to a finish.” "
"8  and i heard the voice out of heaven+ speaking again with me and saying: “go, take the opened scroll that is in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the earth.”+"
"9  i went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll. he said to me: “take it and eat it up,+ and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet like honey.”"
"10  i took the little scroll out of the hand of the angel and ate it,+ and in my mouth it was sweet like honey,+ but when i had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter."
11  and they said to me: “you must prophesy again about peoples and nations and tongues* and many kings.”
"14  then i saw, and look! the lamb+ standing on mount zion,+ and with him 144,000+ who have his name and the name of his father+ written on their foreheads."
2  i heard a sound coming out of heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder; and the sound that i heard was like singers who accompany themselves by playing on their harps.
"3  and they are singing what seems to be a new song+ before the throne and before the four living creatures+ and the elders,+ and no one was able to master that song except the 144,000,+ who have been bought from the earth."
"4  these are the ones who did not defile themselves with women; in fact, they are virgins.+ these are the ones who keep following the lamb no matter where he goes.+ these were bought+ from among mankind as firstfruits+ to god and to the lamb,"
5  and no deceit was found in their mouths; they are without blemish.+ 
"6  and i saw another angel flying in midheaven,* and he had everlasting good news to declare to those who dwell on the earth, to every nation and tribe and tongue* and people.+"
"7  he was saying in a loud voice: “fear god and give him glory, because the hour of judgment by him has arrived,+ so worship the one who made the heaven and the earth and the sea+ and the springs* of water.” "
"8  another, a second angel, followed, saying: “she has fallen! babylon the great+ has fallen,+ she who made all the nations drink of the wine of the passion* of her sexual immorality!”*+ "
"9  another angel, a third, followed them, saying in a loud voice: “if anyone worships the wild beast+ and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,+"
"10  he will also drink of the wine of the anger of god that is poured out undiluted into the cup of his wrath,+ and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur+ in the sight of the holy angels and in the sight of the lamb."
"11  and the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever,+ and day and night they have no rest, those who worship the wild beast and its image and whoever receives the mark of its name.+"
"12  here is where it calls for endurance on the part of the holy ones,+ those who keep the commandments of god and hold fast to the faith+ of jesus.” "
"13  and i heard a voice out of heaven say, “write: happy are the dead who die in union with the lord+ from this time onward. yes, says the spirit, let them rest from their labors, for the things they did go right* with them.” "
"14  then i saw, and look! a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was someone like a son of man,+ with a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. "
"15  another angel emerged from the temple sanctuary, calling with a loud voice to the one seated on the cloud: “put your sickle in and reap, because the hour has come to reap, for the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.”+"
"16  and the one seated on the cloud thrust his sickle into the earth, and the earth was reaped. "
"17  and still another angel emerged from the temple sanctuary that is in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle. "
"18  and still another angel emerged from the altar, and he had authority over the fire. and he called out with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, saying: “put your sharp sickle in and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for its grapes have become ripe.”+"
"19  the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and he hurled it into the great winepress of god’s anger.+"
"20  the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress as high up as the bridles of the horses for a distance of 1,600 stadia.*"
"9  the fifth angel blew his trumpet.+ and i saw a star that had fallen from heaven to the earth, and the key to the shaft* of the abyss+ was given to him."
"2  he opened the shaft* of the abyss, and smoke ascended out of the shaft* like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun was darkened,+ also the air, by the smoke of the shaft.*"
"3  and locusts came out of the smoke onto the earth,+ and authority was given to them, the same authority that the scorpions of the earth have."
"4  they were told not to harm the vegetation of the earth or any green plant or any tree, but only those people who do not have the seal of god on their foreheads.+ "
"5  and it was granted the locusts, not to kill them, but to torment them five months, and their torment was like torment by a scorpion+ when it strikes a person."
"6  in those days people will seek death but will by no means find it, and they will long to die, but death will flee from them. "
"7  and in appearance the locusts resembled horses prepared for battle;+ on their heads were what seemed to be crowns of gold, and their faces were like human faces,"
"8  but they had hair like women’s hair. and their teeth were like those of lions,+"
9  and they had breastplates like iron breastplates. and the sound of their wings was like the sound of horse-drawn chariots rushing into battle.+
"10  also, they have tails with stingers like scorpions, and in their tails is their authority to hurt the people for five months.+"
"11  they have over them a king, the angel of the abyss.+ in hebrew his name is a·badʹdon,* but in greek he has the name a·polʹlyon.* "
12  the one woe is past. look! two more woes+ are coming after these things. 
13  the sixth angel+ blew his trumpet.+ and i heard one voice from the horns of the golden altar+ that is before god
14  say to the sixth angel who had the trumpet: “untie the four angels who are bound at the great river eu·phraʹtes.”+
15  and the four angels who have been prepared for the hour and day and month and year were untied to kill a third of the people. 
16  the number of the armies of cavalry was two myriads of myriads;* i heard the number of them.
"17  and this is how i saw the horses in the vision and those seated on them: they had fire-red and hyacinth-blue and sulfur-yellow breastplates, and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions,+ and fire and smoke and sulfur came out of their mouths."
"18  a third of the people were killed by these three plagues, by the fire and the smoke and the sulfur that came out of their mouths."
"19  for the authority of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails, for their tails are like serpents and have heads, and with these they inflict harm. "
"20  but the rest of the people who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands; they did not stop worshipping the demons and the idols of gold and silver and copper and stone and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk.+"
21  and they did not repent of their murders nor of their spiritistic practices nor of their sexual immorality* nor of their thefts.
"13  and it* stood still on the sand of the sea. and i saw a wild beast+ ascending out of the sea,+ with ten horns and seven heads, and on its horns ten diadems,* but on its heads blasphemous names."
"2  now the wild beast that i saw was like a leopard, but its feet were like those of a bear, and its mouth was like a lion’s mouth. and the dragon+ gave to the beast its power and its throne and great authority.+ "
"3  i saw that one of its heads seemed to have been fatally wounded, but its mortal wound had been healed,+ and all the earth followed the wild beast with admiration."
"4  and they worshipped the dragon because it gave the authority to the wild beast, and they worshipped the wild beast with the words: “who is like the wild beast, and who can do battle with it?”"
"5  it was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and it was given authority to act for 42 months.+"
"6  and it opened its mouth in blasphemies+ against god to blaspheme his name and his dwelling place, even those residing in heaven.+"
"7  it was permitted to wage war with the holy ones and conquer them,+ and it was given authority over every tribe and people and tongue* and nation."
"8  and all those who dwell on the earth will worship it. from the founding of the world, not one of their names has been written in the scroll of life+ of the lamb who was slaughtered.+ "
"9  if anyone has an ear, let him hear.+"
"10  if anyone is meant for captivity, he will go into captivity. if anyone will kill with the sword,* he must be killed with the sword.+ this is where it calls for endurance+ and faith+ on the part of the holy ones.+ "
"11  then i saw another wild beast ascending out of the earth, and it had two horns like a lamb, but it began speaking like a dragon.+"
"12  it exercises all the authority of the first wild beast+ in its sight. and it makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first wild beast, whose mortal wound was healed.+"
"13  and it performs great signs, even making fire come down out of heaven to the earth in the sight of mankind. "
"14  it misleads those who dwell on the earth, because of the signs that it was permitted to perform in the sight of the wild beast, while it tells those who dwell on the earth to make an image+ to the wild beast that had the sword-stroke and yet revived.+"
"15  and it was permitted to give breath* to the image of the wild beast, so that the image of the wild beast should both speak and cause to be killed all those who refuse to worship the image of the wild beast. "
"16  it puts under compulsion all people—the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves—that these should be marked on their right hand or on their forehead,+"
"17  and that nobody can buy or sell except a person having the mark, the name+ of the wild beast or the number of its name.+"
"18  this is where it calls for wisdom: let the one who has insight calculate the number of the wild beast, for it is a man’s number,* and its number is 666.+"
"5  and i saw in the right hand of the one seated on the throne+ a scroll written on both sides,* sealed tight with seven seals."
2  and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice: “who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?”
3  but no one in heaven or on earth or underneath the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it.
4  i gave way to a great deal of weeping because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.
"5  but one of the elders said to me: “stop weeping. look! the lion of the tribe of judah,+ the root+ of david,+ has conquered+ so as to open the scroll and its seven seals.” "
"6  and i saw standing in the midst* of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders+ a lamb+ that seemed to have been slaughtered,+ having seven horns and seven eyes, and the eyes mean the seven spirits of god+ that have been sent out into the whole earth."
7  at once he came forward and took it out of the right hand of the one seated on the throne.+
"8  when he took the scroll, the four living creatures and the 24 elders+ fell down before the lamb, and each one had a harp and golden bowls that were full of incense. (the incense means the prayers of the holy ones.)+"
"9  and they sing a new song,+ saying: “you are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals, for you were slaughtered and with your blood you bought people for god+ out of every tribe and tongue* and people and nation,+"
"10  and you made them to be a kingdom+ and priests to our god,+ and they are to rule as kings+ over the earth.” "
"11  and i saw, and i heard a voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders, and the number of them was myriads of myriads* and thousands of thousands,+"
12  and they were saying with a loud voice: “the lamb who was slaughtered+ is worthy to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.”+ 
"13  and i heard every creature in heaven and on earth and underneath the earth+ and on the sea, and all the things in them, saying: “to the one sitting on the throne+ and to the lamb+ be the blessing and the honor+ and the glory and the might forever and ever.”+"
14  the four living creatures were saying: “amen!” and the elders fell down and worshipped.
"21  and i saw a new heaven and a new earth;+ for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away,+ and the sea+ is no more."
"2  i also saw the holy city, new jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from god+ and prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.+"
"3  with that i heard a loud voice from the throne say: “look! the tent of god is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his people. and god himself will be with them.+"
"4  and he will wipe out every tear from their eyes,+ and death will be no more,+ neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.+ the former things have passed away.” "
"5  and the one seated on the throne+ said: “look! i am making all things new.”+ also he says: “write, for these words are faithful* and true.”"
"6  and he said to me: “they have come to pass! i am the alʹpha and the o·meʹga,* the beginning and the end.+ to anyone thirsting i will give from the spring* of the water of life free.*+"
"7  anyone conquering will inherit these things, and i will be his god and he will be my son."
"8  but as for the cowards and those without faith+ and those who are disgusting in their filth and murderers+ and the sexually immoral*+ and those practicing spiritism and idolaters and all the liars,+ their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur.+ this means the second death.”+ "
"9  one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls that were full of the seven last plagues+ came and said to me: “come, and i will show you the bride, the lamb’s wife.”+"
"10  so he carried me away in the power of the spirit to a great and lofty mountain, and he showed me the holy city jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god+"
"11  and having the glory of god.+ its radiance was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone shining crystal clear.+"
"12  it had a great and lofty wall and had 12 gates with 12 angels at the gates, and on the gates were inscribed the names of the 12 tribes of the sons of israel."
"13  on the east were three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.+"
"14  the wall of the city also had 12 foundation stones, and on them were the 12 names of the 12 apostles+ of the lamb. "
15  now the one who was speaking with me was holding a golden reed as a measure in order to measure the city and its gates and its wall.+
"16  and the city is laid out as a square, and its length is as great as its width. and he measured the city with the reed, 12,000 stadia;* its length and width and height are equal."
"17  he also measured its wall, 144 cubits* according to a man’s measure, at the same time an angel’s measure."
"18  now the wall was made of jasper,+ and the city was pure gold like clear glass."
"19  the foundations of the city wall were adorned with every sort of precious stone: the first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chal·ceʹdo·ny, the fourth emerald,"
"20  the fifth sar·donʹyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysʹo·lite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysʹo·prase, the eleventh hyacinth, the twelfth amethyst."
"21  also, the 12 gates were 12 pearls; each one of the gates was made of one pearl. and the main street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. "
"22  i did not see a temple in it, for jehovah* god the almighty+ is its temple, also the lamb is."
"23  and the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon to shine on it, for the glory of god illuminated it,+ and its lamp was the lamb.+"
"24  and the nations will walk by means of its light,+ and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it."
"25  its gates will not be closed at all by day, for night will not exist there.+"
26  and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.+
27  but anything defiled and anyone who does what is disgusting and deceitful will in no way enter into it;+ only those written in the lamb’s scroll of life will enter.+
"15  and i saw in heaven another sign, great and wonderful, seven angels+ with seven plagues. these are the last ones, because by means of them the anger of god is brought to a finish.+ "
"2  and i saw something like a sea of glass+ mingled with fire, and those who are victorious+ over the wild beast and its image+ and the number of its name+ were standing by the sea of glass, holding harps of god."
"3  they were singing the song of moses+ the slave of god and the song of the lamb,+ saying: “great and wonderful are your works,+ jehovah* god, the almighty.+ righteous and true are your ways,+ king of eternity.+"
"4  who will not really fear you, jehovah,* and glorify your name, for you alone are loyal?+ for all the nations will come and worship before you,+ because your righteous decrees have been revealed.” "
"5  after this i saw, and the sanctuary of the tent of the witness+ was opened in heaven,+"
"6  and the seven angels with the seven plagues+ emerged from the sanctuary, clothed with clean, bright linen and with golden sashes wrapped around their chests."
"7  one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls that were full of the anger of god,+ who lives forever and ever."
"8  and the sanctuary became filled with smoke because of the glory of god+ and because of his power, and no one was able to enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues+ of the seven angels were finished."
"22  and he showed me a river of water of life,+ clear as crystal, flowing out from the throne of god and of the lamb+"
"2  down the middle of its main street. on both sides of the river were trees of life producing 12 crops of fruit, yielding their fruit each month. and the leaves of the trees were for the healing of the nations.+ "
"3  and there will no longer be any curse. but the throne of god and of the lamb+ will be in the city, and his slaves will offer him sacred service;"
"4  and they will see his face,+ and his name will be on their foreheads.+"
"5  also, night will be no more,+ and they have no need of lamplight or sunlight, for jehovah* god will shed light upon them,+ and they will rule as kings forever and ever.+ "
"6  he said to me: “these words are faithful* and true;+ yes, jehovah,* the god who inspired the prophets,+ has sent his angel to show his slaves the things that must shortly take place."
7  look! i am coming quickly.+ happy is anyone observing the words of the prophecy of this scroll.”+ 
"8  well i, john, was the one hearing and seeing these things. when i heard and saw them, i fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing me these things."
9  but he tells me: “be careful! do not do that! i am only a fellow slave of you and of your brothers the prophets and of those observing the words of this scroll. worship god.”+ 
"10  he also tells me: “do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this scroll, for the appointed time is near."
"11  let the one who is unrighteous continue in unrighteousness, and let the filthy one continue in his filth; but let the righteous one continue in righteousness, and let the holy one continue in holiness. "
"12  “‘look! i am coming quickly, and the reward i give is with me, to repay each one according to his work.+"
"13  i am the alʹpha and the o·meʹga,*+ the first and the last, the beginning and the end."
"14  happy are those who wash their robes,+ so that they may have authority to go to the trees of life+ and that they may gain entrance into the city through its gates.+"
15  outside are the dogs* and those who practice spiritism and those who are sexually immoral* and the murderers and the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices lying.’+ 
"16  “‘i, jesus, sent my angel to bear witness to you about these things for the congregations. i am the root and the offspring of david+ and the bright morning star.’”+ "
"17  and the spirit and the bride+ keep on saying, “come!” and let anyone hearing say, “come!” and let anyone thirsting come;+ let anyone who wishes take life’s water free.+ "
"18  “i am bearing witness to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: if anyone makes an addition to these things,+ god will add to him the plagues that are written in this scroll;+"
"19  and if anyone takes anything away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy, god will take his portion away from the trees of life+ and out of the holy city,+ things that are written about in this scroll. "
"20  “the one who bears witness of these things says, ‘yes, i am coming quickly.’”+ “amen! come, lord jesus.” "
21  may the undeserved kindness of the lord jesus be with the holy ones.
