"8 do not be in dread ,"
and do not become paralyzed with fear .
have i not told each of you beforehand and declared it ?
you are my witnesses .
is there any god but me ?
"no , there is no other rock ; i know of none . ’ ”"
"9 all who form carved images amount to nothing ,"
and their cherished objects will be of no benefit .
"as their witnesses , they see nothing and know nothing ,"
so those who made them will be put to shame .
10 who would form a god or cast a metal image
that can bring no benefit ?
11 look ! all his associates will be put to shame !
the craftsmen are mere humans .
let them all assemble and take their stand .
they will be terrified and be put to shame together .
12 the metalsmith works the iron over the coals with his tool .
"he forms it with hammers ,"
working it with his powerful arm .
then he grows hungry and his strength fails ;
he drinks no water and grows tired .
"13 the wood-carver stretches the measuring line , tracing out the pattern with red chalk ."
he works it with a wood scraper and traces it with a compass .
"he patterns it after a man ,"
"with the beauty of a man ,"
to sit in a house .
14 there is one whose work is to cut down cedars .
"he selects a certain type of tree , an oak ,"
and he lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest .
"he plants a laurel tree , and the rain makes it grow ."
15 then it becomes fuel for a man to make fires .
he takes part of it to warm himself ;
he builds a fire and bakes bread .
but he also makes a god and worships it .
"he makes it into a carved image , and he bows down before it ."
16 half of it he burns up in a fire ;
"with that half he roasts the meat that he eats , and he is satisfied ."
he also warms himself and says :
“ ah ! i am warm as i watch the fire . ”
"17 but the rest of it he makes into a god , into his carved image ."
he bows down to it and worships it .
he prays to it and says :
"“ save me , for you are my god . ”"
"18 they know nothing , they understand nothing ,"
"because their eyes are sealed shut and they can not see ,"
and their heart has no insight .
19 no one reflects in his heart
"or has knowledge or understanding , saying :"
"“ half of it i burned up in a fire ,"
and on its coals i baked bread and roasted meat to eat .
"should i , then , make the rest of it into a detestable thing ?"
should i worship a block of wood from a tree ? ”
20 he feeds on ashes .
his own deluded heart has led him astray .
"he can not save himself , nor does he say :"
“ is there not a lie in my right hand ? ”
"21 “ remember these things , o jacob , and you , o israel ,"
for you are my servant .
"i formed you , and you are my servant ."
"o israel , i will not forget you ."
22 i will blot out your transgressions as with a cloud
and your sins as with a thick cloud .
"return to me , for i will repurchase you ."
"23 shout joyfully , you heavens ,"
for jehovah has acted !
"shout in triumph , you depths of the earth !"
"shout for joy , you mountains ,"
"you forest , and all your trees !"
"for jehovah has repurchased jacob ,"
and on israel he displays his splendor . ”
"24 this is what jehovah says , your repurchaser ,"
who formed you since you were in the womb :
"“ i am jehovah , who made everything ."
"i stretched out the heavens by myself ,"
and i spread out the earth .
who was with me ?
"25 i am frustrating the signs of the empty talkers ,"
and i am the one who makes diviners act like fools ;
the one confounding the wise men
and turning their knowledge into foolishness ;
26 the one making the word of his servant come true
and completely fulfilling the predictions of his messengers ;
"the one saying of jerusalem , ‘ she will be inhabited , ’"
"and of the cities of judah , ‘ they will be rebuilt ,"
and i will restore her ruins ’ ;
"27 the one saying to the deep waters , ‘ be evaporated ,"
and i will dry up all your rivers ’ ;
"28 the one saying of cyrus , ‘ he is my shepherd ,"
and he will completely carry out all my will ’ ;
"the one saying of jerusalem , ‘ she will be rebuilt , ’"
"and of the temple , ‘ your foundation will be laid . ’ ”"
"3 this statement is trustworthy : if a man is reaching out to be an overseer , he is desirous of a fine work . 2 the overseer should therefore be irreprehensible , a husband of one wife , moderate in habits , sound in mind , orderly , hospitable , qualified to teach , 3 not a drunkard , not violent , but reasonable , not quarrelsome , not a lover of money , 4 a man presiding over his own household in a fine manner , having his children in subjection with all seriousness 5 ( for if any man does not know how to preside over his own household , how will he care for the congregation of god ? ) , 6 not a newly converted man , for fear that he might get puffed up with pride and fall into the judgment passed on the devil . 7 moreover , he should also have a fine testimony from outsiders so that he does not fall into reproach and a snare of the devil ."
"8 ministerial servants should likewise be serious , not double-tongued , not indulging in a lot of wine , not greedy of dishonest gain , 9 holding the sacred secret of the faith with a clean conscience ."
"10 also , let these be tested as to fitness first ; then let them serve as ministers , as they are free from accusation ."
"11 women should likewise be serious , not slanderous , moderate in habits , faithful in all things ."
"12 let ministerial servants be husbands of one wife , presiding in a fine manner over their children and their own households . 13 for the men who minister in a fine manner are acquiring for themselves a fine standing and great freeness of speech in the faith that is in christ jesus ."
"14 i am writing you these things , though i am hoping to come to you shortly , 15 but in case i am delayed , so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in god ’ s household , which is the congregation of the living god , a pillar and support of the truth . 16 indeed , the sacred secret of this godly devotion is admittedly great : ‘ he was made manifest in flesh , was declared righteous in spirit , appeared to angels , was preached about among nations , was believed upon in the world , was received up in glory . ’"
"3 solʹo·mon made a marriage alliance with pharʹaoh king of egypt . he married pharʹaoh ’ s daughter and brought her to the city of david until he finished building his own house , and the house of jehovah , and the wall around jerusalem . 2 but the people were still sacrificing on the high places , because until that time a house for the name of jehovah had not yet been built . 3 solʹo·mon continued to love jehovah by walking in the statutes of david his father , except that he was sacrificing and making offerings smoke on the high places ."
"4 the king went to gibʹe·on to sacrifice there , for that was the most prominent high place . solʹo·mon offered 1 ,000 burnt sacrifices on that altar . 5 in gibʹe·on jehovah appeared to solʹo·mon in a dream by night , and god said : “ ask what you would like me to give you . ” 6 at this solʹo·mon said : “ you have shown great loyal love toward your servant david my father as he walked before you in faithfulness and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart . you have continued to show him this great loyal love down to this day by giving him a son to sit on his throne . 7 and now , jehovah my god , you have made your servant king in the place of david my father , though i am just a youth and i am inexperienced . 8 your servant is among your people whom you have chosen , a people so vast that they can not be numbered or counted . 9 so grant your servant an obedient heart to judge your people , to discern between good and bad , for who is able to judge this numerous people of yours ? ”"
"10 it was pleasing to jehovah that solʹo·mon had requested this . 11 god then said to him : “ because you requested this and you did not request for yourself long life or riches or the death of your enemies , but you requested understanding to hear judicial cases , 12 i will do what you asked . i will give you a wise and understanding heart , so that just as there has never been anyone like you before , there will never be anyone like you again . 13 furthermore , what you have not requested i will give you , both riches and glory , so that there will be no other king like you in your lifetime . 14 and if you walk in my ways by keeping my regulations and my commandments , just as david your father walked , i will also give you a long life . ”"
"15 when solʹo·mon awoke , he realized that it had been a dream . then he went to jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of jehovah and offered up burnt sacrifices and communion offerings and spread a feast for all his servants ."
"16 at that time two prostitutes came in to the king and stood before him . 17 the first woman said : “ please , my lord , this woman and i live in one house , and i gave birth while she was in the house . 18 on the third day after i gave birth , this woman also gave birth . we were together , just the two of us ; there was no one else with us in the house . 19 during the night this woman ’ s son died , because she lay on him . 20 so she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while your slave girl was asleep and laid him in her arms , and she laid her dead son in my arms . 21 when i got up in the morning to nurse my son , i saw that he was dead . so i examined him closely in the morning and saw that it was not my son whom i had given birth to . ” 22 but the other woman said : “ no , my son is the living one , and your son is the dead one ! ” but the first woman was saying : “ no , your son is the dead one , and my son is the living one . ” that is how they argued before the king ."
"23 finally the king said : “ this one says , ‘ this is my son , the living one , and your son is the dead one ! ’ and that one says , ‘ no , your son is the dead one , and my son is the living one ! ’ ” 24 the king said : “ bring me a sword . ” so they brought a sword to the king . 25 the king then said : “ cut the living child in two , and give half to one woman and half to the other . ” 26 at once the woman whose son was the living one pleaded with the king , for her compassions were stirred toward her son . she said : “ please , my lord ! you should give her the living child ! by no means put him to death ! ” but the other woman was saying : “ he will be neither mine nor yours ! let them cut him in two ! ” 27 at that the king answered : “ give the living child to the first woman ! by no means put him to death , for she is his mother . ”"
"28 so all israel heard about the judgment that the king had handed down , and they were in awe of the king , for they saw that the wisdom of god was with him to execute justice ."
"9 so jehovah said to moses : “ go in to pharʹaoh and say to him , ‘ this is what jehovah the god of the hebrews has said : “ send my people away so that they may serve me . 2 but if you refuse to send them away and you keep holding them , 3 look ! jehovah ’ s hand will come against your livestock in the field . on the horses , the donkeys , the camels , the herd , and the flock , there will be a devastating plague . 4 and jehovah will certainly make a distinction between the livestock of israel and the livestock of egypt , and nothing that belongs to the israelites will die . ” ’ ” 5 moreover , jehovah set an appointed time , saying : “ tomorrow jehovah will do this in the land . ”"
"6 and jehovah did this on the very next day , and all sorts of livestock of egypt began to die , but not one of israel ’ s livestock died . 7 when pharʹaoh inquired , look ! not so much as one of israel ’ s livestock had died . nevertheless , pharʹaoh ’ s heart continued to be unresponsive , and he did not send the people away ."
"8 jehovah then said to moses and aaron : “ fill both of your hands with soot from a kiln , and moses must throw it into the air in front of pharʹaoh . 9 and it will become a fine dust on all the land of egypt , and it will become festering boils on man and beast in all the land of egypt . ”"
"10 so they took soot from a kiln and stood before pharʹaoh , and moses tossed it into the air , and it became festering boils breaking out on man and beast . 11 the magic-practicing priests were unable to stand before moses because of the boils , for they had developed on the magic-practicing priests and on all the egyptians . 12 but jehovah allowed pharʹaoh ’ s heart to become obstinate , and he did not listen to them , just as jehovah had told moses ."
"13 then jehovah said to moses : “ get up early in the morning and station yourself in front of pharʹaoh , and say to him , ‘ this is what jehovah the god of the hebrews has said : “ send my people away so that they may serve me . 14 for now i am directing all my blows to strike your heart , your servants , and your people , so that you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth . 15 for by now i could have thrust my hand out to strike you and your people with a devastating plague , and you would have been wiped out from the earth . 16 but for this very reason i have kept you in existence : to show you my power and to have my name declared in all the earth . 17 are you still behaving arrogantly against my people by not sending them away ? 18 here i will cause a very great hail to rain down tomorrow about this time , such as has never occurred in egypt from the day it was founded until now . 19 therefore , send word to bring all your livestock and all that is yours in the field under shelter . every man and beast caught in the fi"
"20 anyone among pharʹaoh ’ s servants who feared jehovah ’ s word quickly brought his own servants and his livestock into the houses , 21 but whoever did not take jehovah ’ s word to heart left his servants and his livestock in the field ."
"22 jehovah now said to moses : “ stretch out your hand toward the heavens , so that hail may come down on all the land of egypt , on man and beast and all the vegetation of the field in the land of egypt . ” 23 so moses stretched out his rod toward the heavens , and jehovah sent thunder and hail , and fire fell down to the earth , and jehovah kept making it rain down hail on the land of egypt . 24 there was hail , and there was fire flashing in the midst of the hail . it was very heavy ; there had never been any like it in the land since egypt had become a nation . 25 the hail struck everything in the field throughout the land of egypt , from man to beast , and it struck down all the vegetation and shattered all the trees of the field . 26 only in the land of goʹshen , where the israelites were , there was no hail ."
"27 so pharʹaoh sent for moses and aaron and said to them : “ i have sinned this time . jehovah is righteous , and i and my people are in the wrong . 28 plead with jehovah that there may be an end to god ’ s thunder and hail . then i will be willing to send you away , and you will not stay any longer . ” 29 so moses said to him : “ as soon as i go out of the city , i will spread out my hands before jehovah . the thunder will stop and the hail will not continue any longer , so that you may know that the earth belongs to jehovah . 30 but as for you and your servants , i know already that even then , you will not fear jehovah god . ”"
"31 now the flax and the barley had been struck down , because the barley was in the ear and the flax had flower buds . 32 but the wheat and the spelt had not been struck down , because they were later crops . 33 moses now went out of the city from pharʹaoh and spread out his hands before jehovah , and the thunder and the hail stopped and the rain quit pouring down on the earth . 34 when pharʹaoh saw that the rain , the hail , and the thunder had stopped , he sinned again and hardened his heart , he as well as his servants . 35 and pharʹaoh ’ s heart continued obstinate , and he did not send the israelites away , just as jehovah had stated through moses ."
"17 now e·liʹjah the tishʹbite , an inhabitant of gilʹe·ad , said to aʹhab : “ as surely as jehovah the god of israel whom i serve is living , during these years there will be no dew or rain except by my word ! ”"
"2 the word of jehovah came to him , saying : 3 “ leave here , and turn eastward and hide at the valley of cheʹrith , east of the jordan . 4 you should drink from the stream , and i will command the ravens to supply you food there . ” 5 he immediately went and did according to the word of jehovah ; he went and stayed by the valley of cheʹrith , east of the jordan . 6 and the ravens were bringing him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening , and he drank from the stream . 7 but after some days , the stream ran dry , because there was no rain in the land ."
"8 the word of jehovah then came to him : 9 “ rise up , go to zarʹe·phath , which belongs to siʹdon , and stay there . look ! i will command a widow there to supply you with food . ” 10 so he rose up and went to zarʹe·phath . when he came to the entrance of the city , there was a widow gathering pieces of wood . so he called to her and said : “ please , bring me a little water in a cup so that i may drink . ” 11 as she went to get it , he called to her : “ please , bring me a piece of bread in your hand . ” 12 at this she said : “ as surely as jehovah your god is living , i have no bread , only a handful of flour in the large jar and a little oil in the small jar . now i am gathering a few pieces of wood , and i will go in and make something for me and my son . after we have eaten , we will die . ”"
"13 then e·liʹjah said to her : “ do not be afraid . go in and do as you said . but first make me a small round loaf of bread with what is there , and bring it out to me . then you can make something afterward for you and your son . 14 for this is what jehovah the god of israel says : ‘ the large jar of flour will not run out , and the small jar of oil will not run dry until the day jehovah makes it rain on the surface of the ground . ’ ” 15 so she went and did as e·liʹjah said , and she together with him and her household ate for many days . 16 the large jar of flour did not run out , and the small jar of oil did not run dry , according to jehovah ’ s word that he had spoken through e·liʹjah ."
"17 after these things , the son of the woman who owned the house fell sick , and his sickness became so severe that he stopped breathing . 18 at this she said to e·liʹjah : “ what do you have against me , o man of the true god ? have you come to remind me of my guilt and to put my son to death ? ” 19 but he said to her : “ give me your son . ” then he took him from her arms and carried him up to the roof chamber , where he was staying , and he laid him on his own bed . 20 he called out to jehovah : “ o jehovah my god , are you also bringing harm to the widow with whom i am staying by putting her son to death ? ” 21 then he stretched himself out over the child three times and called out to jehovah : “ o jehovah my god , please , let this child ’ s life come back into him . ” 22 jehovah listened to e·liʹjah ’ s request , and the life of the child came back into him , and he revived . 23 e·liʹjah took the child and brought him down from the roof chamber into the house and gave him to his mother ; and e·liʹjah said : “ see , your son is alive"
"9 now concerning the ministry that is for the holy ones , it is not really necessary for me to write you , 2 for i know your willingness about which i am boasting to the mac·e·doʹni·ans , that a·chaʹia has been ready now for a year , and your zeal has stirred up the majority of them . 3 but i am sending the brothers , so that our boasting about you might not prove empty in this respect and that you may really be ready , just as i said you would be . 4 otherwise , if the mac·e·doʹni·ans should come with me and find you not ready , we—not to mention you—should be put to shame by our confidence in you . 5 so i thought it necessary to encourage the brothers to come to you ahead of time and to get your promised bountiful gift ready in advance , so that this might be ready as a generous gift , and not as something extorted ."
"6 but as to this , whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly , and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully . 7 let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart , not grudgingly or under compulsion , for god loves a cheerful giver ."
"8 moreover , god is able to cause all his undeserved kindness to abound toward you so that you are always completely self-sufficient in everything , as well as having plenty for every good work . 9 ( just as it is written : “ he has distributed widely ; he has given to the poor . his righteousness continues forever . ” 10 now the one who abundantly supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating will supply and multiply the seed for you to sow and will increase the harvest of your righteousness . ) 11 in everything you are being enriched for every sort of generosity , which produces through us an expression of thanks to god ; 12 because the ministry of this public service is not only to provide well for the needs of the holy ones but also to be rich in many expressions of thanks to god . 13 through the proof that this relief ministry gives , they glorify god because you are submissive to the good news about the christ , as you publicly declared , and because you are generous in your contribution to them and to all . 14 and with supplicatio"
15 thanks be to god for his indescribable free gift .
42 then job said in reply to jehovah :
2 “ now i know that you are able to do all things
and that nothing you have in mind to do is impossible for you .
"3 you said , ‘ who is this who is obscuring my counsel without knowledge ? ’"
"therefore i spoke , but without understanding"
"about things too wonderful for me , which i do not know ."
"4 you said , ‘ please listen , and i will speak ."
"i will question you , and you inform me . ’"
"5 my ears have heard about you ,"
but now i do see you with my eyes .
"6 that is why i take back what i said ,"
and i repent in dust and ashes . ”
"7 after jehovah had spoken these words to job , jehovah said to elʹi·phaz the teʹman·ite :"
"“ my anger burns against you and your two companions , for you have not spoken the truth about me as my servant job has . 8 now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant job , and offer up a burnt sacrifice for yourselves . and my servant job will pray for you . i will surely accept his request not to deal with you according to your foolishness , for you have not spoken the truth about me as my servant job has . ”"
"9 so elʹi·phaz the teʹman·ite , bilʹdad the shuʹhite , and zoʹphar the naʹa·ma·thite went and did what jehovah had told them to do . and jehovah accepted job ’ s prayer ."
"10 after job had prayed for his companions , jehovah removed job ’ s tribulation and restored his prosperity . jehovah gave him double what he had before . 11 all his brothers and sisters and all his former friends came to him and ate a meal with him in his house . they sympathized with him and comforted him over all the calamity that jehovah had allowed to come upon him . each of them gave him a piece of money and a gold ring ."
"12 so jehovah blessed the last part of job ’ s life more than the beginning , and job came to have 14 ,000 sheep , 6 ,000 camels , 1 ,000 pairs of cattle , and 1 ,000 female donkeys . 13 he also came to have seven more sons and three more daughters . 14 he named the first daughter je·miʹmah , the second ke·ziʹah , and the third kerʹen-hapʹpuch . 15 no women in all the land were as beautiful as job ’ s daughters , and their father gave them an inheritance along with their brothers ."
"16 after this job lived for 140 years , and he saw his children and his grandchildren—four generations . 17 finally job died , after a long and satisfying life ."
"6 children , be obedient to your parents in union with the lord , for this is righteous . 2 “ honor your father and your mother ” is the first command with a promise : 3 “ that it may go well with you and you may remain a long time on the earth . ” 4 and fathers , do not be irritating your children , but go on bringing them up in the discipline and admonition of jehovah ."
"5 slaves , be obedient to your human masters , with fear and trembling in the sincerity of your hearts , as to the christ , 6 not only when being watched , just to please men , but as christ ’ s slaves doing the will of god whole-souled . 7 slave with a good attitude , as to jehovah and not to men , 8 for you know that whatever good each one does , he will receive this back from jehovah , whether he is a slave or a freeman . 9 also , you masters , keep treating them in the same way , not threatening , for you know that both their master and yours is in the heavens , and there is no partiality with him ."
"10 finally , go on acquiring power in the lord and in the mightiness of his strength . 11 put on the complete suit of armor from god so that you may be able to stand firm against the crafty acts of the devil ; 12 because we have a struggle , not against blood and flesh , but against the governments , against the authorities , against the world rulers of this darkness , against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places . 13 for this reason take up the complete suit of armor from god , so that you may be able to resist in the wicked day and , after you have accomplished everything , to stand firm ."
"14 stand firm , therefore , with the belt of truth fastened around your waist , wearing the breastplate of righteousness , 15 and having your feet shod in readiness to declare the good news of peace . 16 besides all of this , take up the large shield of faith , with which you will be able to extinguish all the wicked one ’ s burning arrows . 17 also , accept the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the spirit , that is , god ’ s word , 18 while with every form of prayer and supplication you carry on prayer on every occasion in spirit . and to that end stay awake , constantly making supplication in behalf of all the holy ones . 19 pray also for me , that the words may be given to me when i open my mouth , so that i may be able to speak boldly in making known the sacred secret of the good news , 20 for which i am acting as an ambassador in chains , and that i may speak about it with boldness , as i ought to speak ."
"21 now so that you may also know about me and how i am doing , tychʹi·cus , a beloved brother and faithful minister in the lord , will make everything known to you . 22 i am sending him to you for this very purpose , so that you may know how we are and that he may comfort your hearts ."
23 may the brothers have peace and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ . 24 may the undeserved kindness be with all those loving our lord jesus christ in incorruptness .
"16 the word of jehovah against baʹa·sha then came to jeʹhu the son of ha·naʹni , saying : 2 “ i raised you up out of the dust and made you leader over my people israel , but you kept walking in the way of jer·o·boʹam and caused my people israel to sin so that they offended me with their sins . 3 so i am making a clean sweep of baʹa·sha and his house , and i will make his house like the house of jer·o·boʹam the son of neʹbat . 4 anyone belonging to baʹa·sha who dies in the city the dogs will eat ; and anyone belonging to him who dies in the field the birds of the heavens will eat . ”"
"5 as for the rest of the history of baʹa·sha , what he did and his mightiness , is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of israel ? 6 then baʹa·sha was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in tirʹzah ; and eʹlah his son became king in his place . 7 also through the prophet jeʹhu the son of ha·naʹni , jehovah ’ s word came against baʹa·sha and his house , both because of all the badness that he committed in the eyes of jehovah by offending him with the work of his hands , becoming like the house of jer·o·boʹam , and also because of his striking him down ."
"8 in the 26th year of king aʹsa of judah , eʹlah the son of baʹa·sha became king over israel in tirʹzah , and he reigned for two years . 9 his servant zimʹri , the chief of half of his chariot forces , conspired against him while he was in tirʹzah drinking himself drunk at the house of arʹza , who was over the household in tirʹzah . 10 zimʹri came in and struck him down and put him to death in the 27th year of king aʹsa of judah , and he became king in his place . 11 when he became king , as soon as he sat down on his throne , he struck down all the house of baʹa·sha . he did not spare a single male , whether of his relatives or of his friends . 12 thus zimʹri annihilated the whole house of baʹa·sha , according to the word that jehovah had spoken against baʹa·sha through jeʹhu the prophet . 13 this was for all the sins that baʹa·sha and his son eʹlah had committed and the sins they had caused israel to commit by offending jehovah the god of israel with their worthless idols . 14 as for the rest of the history of eʹlah , all that he did , i"
"15 in the 27th year of king aʹsa of judah , zimʹri became king for seven days in tirʹzah while the troops were camped against gibʹbe·thon , which belonged to the phi·lisʹtines . 16 in time the troops who were encamped heard it being said : “ zimʹri has conspired and has also struck down the king . ” so all israel made omʹri , the chief of the army , king over israel on that day in the camp . 17 omʹri and all israel with him went up from gibʹbe·thon and laid siege to tirʹzah . 18 when zimʹri saw that the city had been captured , he went into the fortified tower of the king ’ s house and burned the house down over himself , and he died . 19 this was for his own sins that he had committed by doing what was bad in the eyes of jehovah by walking in the way of jer·o·boʹam and for the sin he had caused israel to commit . 20 as for the rest of the history of zimʹri and his conspiracy , is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of israel ?"
"21 it was then that the people of israel were divided into two factions . one part of the people became followers of tibʹni the son of giʹnath , wanting to make him king , and the other part followed omʹri . 22 but the people who were following omʹri prevailed over the people following tibʹni the son of giʹnath . so tibʹni died , and omʹri became king ."
"23 in the 31st year of king aʹsa of judah , omʹri became king over israel , and he reigned for 12 years . in tirʹzah he reigned for six years . 24 he bought the mountain of sa·marʹi·a from sheʹmer for two talents of silver , and he built a city on the mountain . he named the city that he built sa·marʹi·a , after sheʹmer the owner of the mountain . 25 omʹri kept doing what was bad in the eyes of jehovah , and he was worse than all who were prior to him . 26 he walked in all the ways of jer·o·boʹam the son of neʹbat and in the sin he had caused israel to commit by offending jehovah the god of israel with their worthless idols . 27 as for the rest of the history of omʹri , what he did and his mighty exploits , is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of israel ? 28 then omʹri was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in sa·marʹi·a ; and his son aʹhab became king in his place ."
"29 aʹhab the son of omʹri became king over israel in the 38th year of king aʹsa of judah , and aʹhab the son of omʹri reigned over israel in sa·marʹi·a for 22 years . 30 aʹhab the son of omʹri was worse in the eyes of jehovah than all those who were prior to him . 31 as if it were a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of jer·o·boʹam the son of neʹbat , he also took as wife jezʹe·bel the daughter of eth·baʹal , the king of the si·doʹni·ans , and began to serve baʹal and to bow down to him . 32 further , he set up an altar to baʹal at the house of baʹal that he built in sa·marʹi·a . 33 aʹhab also made the sacred pole . aʹhab did more to offend jehovah the god of israel than all the kings of israel prior to him ."
"34 in his days , hiʹel the bethʹel·ite rebuilt jerʹi·cho . at the cost of a·biʹram his firstborn he laid its foundation , and at the cost of seʹgub his youngest he put up its doors , according to the word of jehovah spoken through joshua the son of nun ."
"8 then jehovah said to moses : “ go in to pharʹaoh and say to him , ‘ this is what jehovah says : “ send my people away so that they may serve me . 2 if you keep refusing to send them away , i will plague all your territory with frogs . 3 and the nile river will swarm with frogs , and they will come up and enter into your house , into your bedroom , on your bed , into the houses of your servants and on your people , into your ovens , and into your kneading troughs . 4 on you , on your people , and on all your servants , the frogs will come up . ” ’ ”"
"5 jehovah later said to moses : “ say to aaron , ‘ stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers , the nile canals , and the marshes , and make the frogs come up over the land of egypt . ’ ” 6 so aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of egypt , and the frogs began to come up and to cover the land of egypt . 7 however , the magic-practicing priests did the same thing by their secret arts , and they too made the frogs come up over the land of egypt . 8 pharʹaoh then called moses and aaron and said : “ plead with jehovah to remove the frogs from me and my people , as i want to send the people away so that they may sacrifice to jehovah . ” 9 then moses said to pharʹaoh : “ i leave to you the honor of telling me when i should plead to have the frogs removed from you , your servants , your people , and your houses . only in the nile river will they be left . ” 10 to this he said : “ tomorrow . ” so he said : “ it will be according to your word so that you may know that there is no one else like jehovah our god . 11 the frogs will de"
"12 so moses and aaron went out from pharʹaoh , and moses pleaded with jehovah about the frogs that he had brought upon pharʹaoh . 13 then jehovah did as moses asked , and the frogs began to die in the houses , the courtyards , and the fields . 14 they were piling them up in countless heaps , and the land began to stink . 15 when pharʹaoh saw that there was relief , he hardened his heart and he refused to listen to them , just as jehovah had said ."
"16 jehovah now said to moses : “ say to aaron , ‘ stretch out your rod and strike the dust of the earth , and it must become gnats in all the land of egypt . ’ ” 17 and they did this . aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and struck the dust of the earth , and the gnats came on man and beast . all the dust of the earth became gnats in all the land of egypt . 18 the magic-practicing priests tried to do the same and produce gnats by their secret arts , but they could not . and the gnats came on man and beast . 19 so the magic-practicing priests said to pharʹaoh : “ it is the finger of god ! ” but pharʹaoh ’ s heart continued to be obstinate , and he did not listen to them , just as jehovah had said ."
"20 then jehovah said to moses : “ get up early in the morning and station yourself in front of pharʹaoh . look ! he is coming out to the water ! and you must say to him , ‘ this is what jehovah has said : “ send my people away so that they may serve me . 21 but if you do not send my people away , i will send on you , your servants , and your people and into your houses the gadfly ; and the houses of egypt will be full of gadflies , and they will even cover the ground they stand on . 22 on that day i will certainly set apart the land of goʹshen , where my people are dwelling . no gadflies will exist there , and by this you will know that i , jehovah , am here in the land . 23 and i will make a distinction between my people and your people . tomorrow this sign will take place . ” ’ ”"
"24 and jehovah did so , and heavy swarms of gadflies began to invade the house of pharʹaoh and the houses of his servants and all the land of egypt . the land was ruined by the gadflies . 25 finally , pharʹaoh called moses and aaron and said : “ go , sacrifice to your god in the land . ” 26 but moses said : “ it is not proper to do so , because what we would sacrifice to jehovah our god would be detestable to the egyptians . if we would make a sacrifice that was detestable to the egyptians right before their eyes , would they not stone us ? 27 we will make a three-day journey into the wilderness , and there we will sacrifice to jehovah our god , just as he has said to us . ”"
"28 pharʹaoh now said : “ i will send you away to sacrifice to jehovah your god in the wilderness . only , you must not go so far away . plead in my behalf . ” 29 then moses said : “ now i am going away from you , and i will plead with jehovah , and the gadflies will depart from pharʹaoh , his servants , and his people tomorrow . but pharʹaoh must stop trifling with us by refusing to send the people away to sacrifice to jehovah . ” 30 moses then went out from pharʹaoh and pleaded with jehovah . 31 so jehovah did according to moses ’ word , and the gadflies departed from pharʹaoh , his servants , and his people . not one was left . 32 however , pharʹaoh again hardened his heart and did not send the people away ."
"1 in the second year of king da·riʹus , in the sixth month , on the first day of the month , the word of jehovah came through hagʹgai the prophet to ze·rubʹba·bel son of she·alʹti·el , the governor of judah , and to joshua son of je·hozʹa·dak , the high priest , saying :"
"2 “ this is what jehovah of armies says , ‘ these people say , “ the time has not yet come for the house of jehovah to be built . ” ’ ”"
"3 and the word of jehovah again came through hagʹgai the prophet , saying : 4 “ is it the time for you to dwell in your paneled houses , while this house lies in ruins ? 5 now this is what jehovah of armies says , ‘ set your heart on your ways . 6 you have sown much seed , but you harvest little . you eat , but it is not to satisfaction . you drink , but you do not drink your fill . you put on clothing , but no one gets warm . the one who hires himself out puts his wages in a bag full of holes . ’ ”"
"7 “ this is what jehovah of armies says , ‘ set your heart on your ways . ’"
"8 “ ‘ go up to the mountain and bring in lumber . and build the house , so that i may take pleasure in it and i may be glorified , ’ jehovah says . ”"
"9 “ ‘ you were expecting much and receiving little ; and when you brought it into the house , i blew it away . for what reason ? ’ declares jehovah of armies . ‘ because my house is in ruins , while each of you runs around taking care of his own house . 10 so the heavens above you withheld their dew , and the earth withheld its produce . 11 and i kept calling for a drought on the earth , on the mountains , on the grain , on the new wine , on the oil , on what grows from the ground , on humans and livestock , and on all the labor of your hands . ’ ”"
"12 ze·rubʹba·bel son of she·alʹti·el and joshua son of je·hozʹa·dak , the high priest , and all the rest of the people listened to the voice of jehovah their god and to the words of hagʹgai the prophet , because jehovah their god had sent him ; and the people began to show fear because of jehovah ."
"13 then hagʹgai , the messenger of jehovah , gave this message to the people in harmony with his commission from jehovah : “ ‘ i am with you people , ’ declares jehovah . ”"
"14 so jehovah stirred up the spirit of ze·rubʹba·bel the son of she·alʹti·el , the governor of judah , and the spirit of joshua the son of je·hozʹa·dak , the high priest , and the spirit of all the rest of the people ; and they came and began to work on the house of jehovah of armies , their god . 15 this was on the 24th day of the sixth month in the second year of king da·riʹus ."
"8 now we want you to know , brothers , about the undeserved kindness of god that has been granted to the congregations of mac·e·doʹni·a . 2 during a great test under affliction , their abundance of joy and their deep poverty made the riches of their generosity abound . 3 for it was according to their means , yes , i testify , it was even beyond their means , 4 while they on their own initiative kept earnestly begging us for the privilege of kindly giving , to have a share in the relief ministry for the holy ones . 5 and not merely as we had hoped , but first they gave themselves to the lord and to us through god ’ s will . 6 so we encouraged titus that , just as he had initiated this work among you , he should also complete this same kind giving on your part . 7 nevertheless , just as you abound in everything , in faith and word and knowledge and all earnestness and in our love for you , may you also abound in this kind giving ."
"8 i am saying this , not to command you , but to make you aware of the earnestness of others and to test the genuineness of your love . 9 for you know the undeserved kindness of our lord jesus christ , that although he was rich , he became poor for your sake , so that you might become rich through his poverty ."
"10 and in this i give my opinion : this is for your benefit , seeing that already a year ago you not only initiated the action but also showed your desire to do it . 11 so now , also complete what you started to do , so that your readiness to act may be completed according to the means you have available . 12 for if the readiness is there first , it is especially acceptable according to what a person has , not according to what a person does not have . 13 for i do not want to make it easy for others , but difficult for you ; 14 but that by means of an equalizing , your surplus at the present time might offset their need , so that their surplus might also offset your deficiency , that there may be an equalizing . 15 just as it is written : “ the person with much did not have too much , and the person with little did not have too little . ”"
"16 now thanks be to god for putting the same earnest concern for you in the heart of titus , 17 because he has indeed responded to the encouragement , but being very eager , he is coming to you on his own initiative . 18 but we are sending along with him the brother whose praise in connection with the good news has spread through all the congregations . 19 not only that , but he was also appointed by the congregations to be our traveling companion as we administer this kind gift for the glory of the lord and in proof of our readiness to assist . 20 thus we are avoiding having any man find fault with us in connection with this liberal contribution that we are administering . 21 for we ‘ care for everything honestly , not only in the sight of jehovah but also in the sight of men . ’"
"22 moreover , we are sending with them our brother whom we have often tested and found to be diligent in many matters , but now much more diligent on account of his great confidence in you . 23 if , though , there is any question about titus , he is my companion and a fellow worker for your interests ; or if there are questions about our brothers , they are apostles of congregations and a glory of christ . 24 so demonstrate the proof of your love to them , and show the congregations why we boasted about you ."
"2 first of all , then , i urge that supplications , prayers , intercessions , and thanksgiving be made concerning all sorts of men , 2 concerning kings and all those who are in high positions , so that we may go on leading a calm and quiet life with complete godly devotion and seriousness . 3 this is fine and acceptable in the sight of our savior , god , 4 whose will is that all sorts of people should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth . 5 for there is one god , and one mediator between god and men , a man , christ jesus , 6 who gave himself a corresponding ransom for all—this is what is to be witnessed to in its own due time . 7 for the purpose of this witness i was appointed a preacher and an apostle—i am telling the truth , i am not lying—a teacher of nations in the matter of faith and truth ."
"8 so i desire that in every place the men carry on prayer , lifting up loyal hands , without anger and debates . 9 likewise , the women should adorn themselves in appropriate dress , with modesty and soundness of mind , not with styles of hair braiding and gold or pearls or very expensive clothing , 10 but in the way that is proper for women professing devotion to god , namely , through good works ."
"11 let a woman learn in silence with full submissiveness . 12 i do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man , but she is to remain silent . 13 for adam was formed first , then eve . 14 also , adam was not deceived , but the woman was thoroughly deceived and became a transgressor . 15 however , she will be kept safe through childbearing , provided she continues in faith and love and holiness along with soundness of mind ."
"2 when the time of david ’ s death drew near , he gave his son solʹo·mon these instructions : 2 “ i am about to die . therefore , be strong and prove yourself a man . 3 you must keep your obligation to jehovah your god by walking in his ways and by observing his statutes , his commandments , his judgments , and his reminders as they are written in the law of moses ; then you will succeed in everything you do and everywhere you turn . 4 and jehovah will carry out his promise that he made concerning me : ‘ if your sons pay attention to their way by walking faithfully before me with all their heart and soul , there will never fail to be a man of your line sitting on the throne of israel . ’"
"5 “ you also well know what joʹab the son of ze·ruʹiah did to me , what he did to two chiefs of the armies of israel—abʹner the son of ner and a·maʹsa the son of jeʹther . he killed them , shedding the blood of war in peacetime , and he put the blood of war on the belt around his waist and on the sandals on his feet . 6 you must act according to your wisdom and not let his gray hairs go down in peace to the grave ."
"7 “ but toward the sons of bar·zilʹlai the gilʹe·ad·ite , you should show loyal love , and they should be among those eating at your table , for that was how they stood by me when i ran away from your brother abʹsa·lom ."
"8 “ there is also with you shimʹe·i the son of geʹra the benʹja·min·ite from ba·huʹrim . he was the one who cursed me with a vicious curse on the day that i was going to ma·ha·naʹim ; but when he came down to meet me at the jordan , i swore to him by jehovah : ‘ i will not put you to death by the sword . ’ 9 now do not leave him unpunished , for you are a wise man and you know what you should do to him ; you must bring his gray hairs down to the grave with blood . ”"
"10 then david was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in the city of david . 11 the length of david ’ s reign over israel was 40 years . in hebʹron he reigned for 7 years , and in jerusalem he reigned for 33 years ."
"12 solʹo·mon then sat down on the throne of david his father , and gradually his kingship became firmly established ."
"13 in time ad·o·niʹjah the son of hagʹgith came to bath-sheʹba , solʹo·mon ’ s mother . she asked : “ is your coming peaceable ? ” he replied : “ it is peaceable . ” 14 he then said : “ i have something to say to you . ” so she said : “ speak . ” 15 he continued : “ you well know that the kingship was to become mine , and all israel expected me to become king ; but the kingship eluded me and became my brother ’ s , for it was from jehovah that it became his . 16 but now there is just one request that i am making of you . do not turn me away . ” so she said to him : “ speak . ” 17 he then said : “ please , ask solʹo·mon the king—for he will not turn you away—to give me abʹi·shag the shuʹnam·mite as a wife . ” 18 to this bath-sheʹba said : “ very well ! i will speak for you to the king . ”"
"19 so bath-sheʹba went in to king solʹo·mon to speak to him for ad·o·niʹjah . at once the king rose to meet her and bowed down to her . then he sat down on his throne and had a throne set for the king ’ s mother , so that she could sit at his right . 20 she then said : “ there is one small request that i am making of you . do not turn me away . ” so the king said to her : “ make it , my mother ; for i will not turn you away . ” 21 she said : “ let abʹi·shag the shuʹnam·mite be given as a wife to your brother ad·o·niʹjah . ” 22 at this king solʹo·mon answered his mother : “ why are you requesting abʹi·shag the shuʹnam·mite for ad·o·niʹjah ? you may as well request the kingship for him , for he is my older brother , and supporting him are a·biʹa·thar the priest and joʹab the son of ze·ruʹiah . ”"
"23 with that king solʹo·mon swore by jehovah : “ so may god do to me and add to it if it was not at the cost of his own life that ad·o·niʹjah made this request . 24 and now , as surely as jehovah is living , who has firmly established me and seated me on the throne of david my father and who made a house for me , just as he promised , ad·o·niʹjah will be put to death today . ” 25 king solʹo·mon immediately sent be·naiʹah the son of je·hoiʹa·da , who went out and struck ad·o·niʹjah down , and he died ."
"26 to a·biʹa·thar the priest , the king said : “ go to your fields in anʹa·thoth ! you deserve to die , but on this day i will not put you to death because you carried the ark of the sovereign lord jehovah before david my father and because you shared in all the hardships that my father suffered . ” 27 so solʹo·mon drove a·biʹa·thar out from serving as a priest of jehovah , to fulfill jehovah ’ s word against the house of eʹli in shiʹloh ."
"28 when the news reached joʹab—for joʹab had supported ad·o·niʹjah but he had not supported abʹsa·lom—joʹab fled to the tent of jehovah and grabbed hold of the horns of the altar . 29 then king solʹo·mon was told : “ joʹab has fled to the tent of jehovah , and he is there beside the altar . ” so solʹo·mon sent be·naiʹah the son of je·hoiʹa·da , saying : “ go , strike him down ! ” 30 so be·naiʹah went to the tent of jehovah and said to him : “ this is what the king says , ‘ come out ! ’ ” but he said : “ no ! i will die here . ” be·naiʹah brought word back to the king : “ this is what joʹab said , and this is what he answered me . ” 31 then the king said to him : “ do just as he said ; strike him down and bury him and remove from me and from the house of my father the blood that joʹab spilled without just cause . 32 jehovah will bring his blood back on his own head , for without my father david ’ s knowledge , he struck down and killed with the sword two men more righteous and better than he was : abʹner the son of ner , the chief of the ar"
"36 then the king summoned shimʹe·i and said to him : “ build yourself a house in jerusalem , and live there ; do not go out from there to any other place . 37 on the day you go out and cross the kidʹron valley , you can be sure that you will die . your blood will be on your own head . ” 38 shimʹe·i replied to the king : “ what you have said is fair . your servant will do just as my lord the king has said . ” so shimʹe·i stayed in jerusalem for many days ."
"39 but at the end of three years , two of shimʹe·i ’ s slaves ran away to aʹchish the son of maʹa·cah the king of gath . when shimʹe·i was told : “ look ! your slaves are in gath , ” 40 shimʹe·i immediately saddled his donkey and went to see aʹchish in gath to find his slaves . when shimʹe·i returned from gath with his slaves , 41 solʹo·mon was told : “ shimʹe·i has gone out of jerusalem to gath and has returned . ” 42 at that the king summoned shimʹe·i and said to him : “ did i not put you under oath by jehovah and warn you : ‘ on the day you go out from here to any other place , you can be sure that you will die ’ ? and did you not say to me , ‘ what you are saying is fair ; i will obey ’ ? 43 why , then , did you not keep the oath of jehovah and the commandment that i imposed on you ? ” 44 the king then said to shimʹe·i : “ you know in your heart all the injury that you did to david my father , and jehovah will bring back that injury on your own head . 45 but king solʹo·mon will be blessed , and the throne of david will be firmly establ"
thus the kingdom was firmly established in the hand of solʹo·mon .
23 “ woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture ! ” declares jehovah .
"2 therefore this is what jehovah the god of israel says against the shepherds who are shepherding my people : “ you have scattered my sheep ; you kept dispersing them , and you have not turned your attention to them . ”"
"“ so i will turn my attention to you because of your evil deeds , ” declares jehovah ."
"3 “ then i will gather together the remnant of my sheep from all the lands to which i have dispersed them , and i will bring them back to their pasture , and they will be fruitful and become many . 4 and i will raise up over them shepherds who will really shepherd them . they will no longer be afraid or be terrified , and none will be missing , ” declares jehovah ."
"5 “ look ! the days are coming , ” declares jehovah , “ when i will raise up to david a righteous sprout . and a king will reign and show insight and uphold justice and righteousness in the land . 6 in his days judah will be saved , and israel will reside in security . and this is the name by which he will be called : jehovah is our righteousness . ”"
"7 “ however , the days are coming , ” declares jehovah , “ when they will no longer say , ‘ as surely as jehovah is alive , who brought the people of israel out of the land of egypt ! ’ 8 but rather , ‘ as surely as jehovah is alive , who brought out and brought back the descendants of the house of israel from the land of the north and from all the lands to which i had dispersed them , ’ and they will dwell in their own land . ”"
9 concerning the prophets :
my heart is broken within me .
all my bones are shaking .
i am like a man who is drunk
"and like a man overcome by wine ,"
because of jehovah and because of his holy words .
10 for the land is full of adulterers ;
because of the curse the land has gone into mourning
and the pastures of the wilderness have dried up .
"their course is evil , and they abuse their power ."
11 “ both the prophet and the priest are polluted .
"even in my own house i have found their wickedness , ” declares jehovah ."
12 “ so their path will become slippery and dark ;
they will be pushed and will fall .
for i will bring calamity on them
"in the year of reckoning , ” declares jehovah ."
13 “ and in the prophets of sa·marʹi·a i have seen what is repulsive .
"their prophecies are incited by baʹal ,"
and they lead my people israel astray .
14 and in the prophets of jerusalem i have seen horrible things .
they commit adultery and walk in falsehood ;
"they encourage evildoers ,"
and they do not turn away from their wickedness .
"to me they are all like sodʹom ,"
and her inhabitants are like go·morʹrah . ”
15 therefore this is what jehovah of armies says against the prophets :
“ here i am making them eat wormwood
and giving them poisoned water to drink .
for from the prophets of jerusalem apostasy has spread throughout the land . ”
16 this is what jehovah of armies says :
“ do not listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you .
they are deluding you .
"the vision they speak is from their own heart ,"
not from the mouth of jehovah .
"17 they are saying again and again to those who disrespect me ,"
‘ jehovah has said : “ you will enjoy peace . ” ’
"and to everyone who follows his own stubborn heart they say ,"
‘ no calamity will come upon you . ’
18 for who has stood in the inner circle of jehovah
to see and hear his word ?
who has paid attention to his word in order to hear it ?
19 look ! the windstorm of jehovah will burst out in fury ;
like a whirling tempest it will whirl down on the head of the wicked .
20 the anger of jehovah will not turn back
until he has carried out and accomplished the intentions of his heart .
in the final part of the days you will clearly understand this .
"21 i did not send the prophets , yet they ran ."
"i did not speak to them , yet they prophesied ."
"22 but if they had stood in my inner circle ,"
they would have made my people hear my words
and would have caused them to turn back from their bad way and their evil deeds . ”
"23 “ am i only a god nearby , ” declares jehovah , “ and not a god also from far away ? ”"
24 “ can any man hide in a concealed place where i can not see him ? ” declares jehovah .
“ do i not fill the heavens and the earth ? ” declares jehovah .
"25 “ i have heard the prophets who are prophesying lies in my name say , ‘ i had a dream ! i had a dream ! ’ 26 how long will this continue in the heart of the prophets , to prophesy lies ? they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart . 27 they intend to make my people forget my name by the dreams they relate to one another , just as their fathers forgot my name because of baʹal . 28 let the prophet who has a dream relate the dream , but the one who has my word should speak my word truthfully . ”"
“ what does the straw have in common with the grain ? ” declares jehovah .
"29 “ is not my word just like a fire , ” declares jehovah , “ and like a forge hammer that smashes the crag ? ”"
"30 “ so here i am against the prophets , ” declares jehovah , “ who steal my words from one another . ”"
"31 “ here i am against the prophets , ” declares jehovah , “ those who use their tongue to say , ‘ he declares ! ’ ”"
"32 “ here i am against the prophets of lying dreams , ” declares jehovah , “ who relate them and lead my people astray because of their lies and their boasting . ”"
"“ but i did not send them or command them . so they will not benefit this people at all , ” declares jehovah ."
"33 “ and when this people or a prophet or a priest asks you , ‘ what is the burden of jehovah ? ’ you should reply to them , ‘ “ you people are the burden ! and i will cast you off , ” declares jehovah . ’ 34 as for the prophet or the priest or the people who say , ‘ this is the burden of jehovah ! ’ i will turn my attention on that man and on his household . 35 this is what each of you is saying to his fellow and to his brother , ‘ what has jehovah answered ? and what has jehovah spoken ? ’ 36 but the burden of jehovah you should mention no more , for the burden is each one ’ s own word , and you have changed the words of the living god , jehovah of armies , our god ."
"37 “ this is what you will say to the prophet , ‘ what answer has jehovah given you ? and what has jehovah spoken ? 38 and if you keep saying , “ the burden of jehovah ! ” this is what jehovah says : “ because of your saying , ‘ this word is the burden of jehovah , ’ after i told you , ‘ you must not say : “ the burden of jehovah ! ” ’ 39 look ! i will lift you up and throw you away from my presence , both you and the city that i gave to you and your forefathers . 40 and i will bring on you everlasting disgrace and everlasting humiliation , which will not be forgotten . ” ’ ”"
"34 then jehovah said to moses : “ carve out for yourself two tablets of stone like the first ones , and i will write on the tablets the words that appeared on the first tablets , which you shattered . 2 get ready for the morning , as you will go up in the morning to mount siʹnai and station yourself before me there on the top of the mountain . 3 but nobody may go up with you , and nobody else should be seen anywhere on the mountain . not even the flocks or herds should graze in front of that mountain . ”"
"4 so moses carved out two tablets of stone like the first ones and got up early in the morning and went up mount siʹnai , just as jehovah had commanded him , and he took the two tablets of stone in his hand . 5 then jehovah came down in the cloud and stationed himself with him there and declared the name of jehovah . 6 jehovah was passing before him and declaring : “ jehovah , jehovah , a god merciful and compassionate , slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth , 7 showing loyal love to thousands , pardoning error and transgression and sin , but he will by no means leave the guilty unpunished , bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons and upon grandsons , upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation . ”"
"8 moses hurried to bow low to the earth and prostrate himself . 9 then he said : “ if , now , i have found favor in your eyes , o jehovah , then please , jehovah , go along with us in our midst , although we are an obstinate people , and forgive our error and our sin , and take us as your own possession . ” 10 in turn he said : “ here i am making a covenant : before all your people , i will do wonderful things that have never been done in all the earth or among all the nations , and all the people among whom you live will see the work of jehovah , for it is an awe-inspiring thing that i am doing with you ."
"11 “ pay attention to what i am commanding you today . here i am driving out from before you the amʹor·ites , the caʹnaan·ites , the hitʹtites , the perʹiz·zites , the hiʹvites , and the jebʹu·sites . 12 be careful that you do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you are going , or it may prove to be a snare among you . 13 but you are to pull down their altars , you are to shatter their sacred pillars , and their sacred poles you are to cut down . 14 you must not bow down to another god , for jehovah is known for requiring exclusive devotion . yes , he is a god who requires exclusive devotion . 15 be careful not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land , because when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to their gods , someone will invite you and you will eat from his sacrifice . 16 then you will surely take some of their daughters for your sons , and their daughters will prostitute themselves to their gods and cause your sons to prostitute themselves to their gods ."
17 “ you must not make gods of cast metal .
"18 “ you are to observe the festival of unleavened bread . you will eat unleavened bread , just as i have commanded you ; do this for seven days at the appointed time in the month of aʹbib , because it was in the month of aʹbib that you came out of egypt ."
"19 “ every firstborn male is mine , including all your livestock , whether the first male bull or sheep . 20 the firstling of a donkey you are to redeem with a sheep . but if you do not redeem it , then you must break its neck . you are to redeem every firstborn of your sons . no one may appear before me empty-handed ."
"21 “ six days you are to work , but on the seventh day you will rest . even during plowing time and in harvest , you will rest ."
"22 “ and you will celebrate your festival of weeks with the first ripe fruits of the wheat harvest , and the festival of ingathering at the turn of the year ."
"23 “ three times a year , all your men are to appear before the true lord , jehovah , the god of israel . 24 for i will drive the nations away from before you , and i will enlarge your territory , and nobody will desire your land while you are going up to see the face of jehovah your god three times a year ."
25 “ you must not offer the blood of my sacrifice along with anything leavened . the sacrifice of the festival of the passover should not be kept overnight until the morning .
26 “ the best of the first ripe fruits of your soil you are to bring to the house of jehovah your god .
“ you must not boil a young goat in its mother ’ s milk . ”
"27 jehovah went on to say to moses : “ you are to write down these words , because in accordance with these words , i am making a covenant with you and with israel . ” 28 and he remained there with jehovah 40 days and 40 nights . he ate no bread and drank no water . and he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant , the ten commandments ."
"29 moses then came down from mount siʹnai , and the two tablets of the testimony were in his hand . when he came down from the mountain , moses did not know that the skin of his face was emitting rays because he had been speaking with god . 30 when aaron and all the israelites saw moses , they noticed that the skin of his face emitted rays and they were afraid to go near him ."
"31 but moses called to them , so aaron and all the chieftains of the assembly came to him , and moses spoke with them . 32 after that all the israelites came near to him , and he gave them all the commands that jehovah had given him on mount siʹnai . 33 when moses would finish speaking with them , he would put a veil over his face . 34 but when moses would go in before jehovah to speak with him , he would take off the veil until he went out . then he went out and revealed to the israelites the commands he had received . 35 and the israelites saw that the skin of moses ’ face emitted rays ; then moses put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with god ."
"45 this is what jehovah says to his anointed one , to cyrus ,"
whose right hand i have taken hold of
"to subdue nations before him ,"
"to disarm kings ,"
"to open before him the double doors ,"
so that the gates will not be shut :
"2 “ before you i will go ,"
and the hills i will level .
"the copper doors i will break in pieces ,"
and the iron bars i will cut down .
3 i will give you the treasures in the darkness
"and the hidden treasures in the concealed places ,"
"so that you may know that i am jehovah ,"
"the god of israel , who is calling you by your name ."
"4 for the sake of my servant jacob and of israel my chosen one ,"
i am calling you by your name .
"i am giving you a name of honor , although you did not know me ."
"5 i am jehovah , and there is no one else ."
there is no god except me .
"i will strengthen you , although you did not know me ,"
6 in order that people may know
from the rising of the sun to its setting
that there is none besides me .
"i am jehovah , and there is no one else ."
"7 i form light and create darkness ,"
i make peace and create calamity ;
"i , jehovah , am doing all these things ."
"8 you heavens , rain down from above ;"
let the clouds pour down righteousness .
"let the earth open up and be fruitful with salvation ,"
and let it cause righteousness to spring up at the same time .
"i , jehovah , have created it . ”"
"9 woe to the one who contends with his maker ,"
for he is just an earthenware fragment
among the other earthenware fragments lying on the ground !
should the clay say to the potter : “ what are you making ? ”
or should your work say : “ he has no hands ” ?
10 woe to the one who says to a father : “ what do you become father to ? ”
and to a woman : “ what are you giving birth to ? ”
"11 this is what jehovah says , the holy one of israel , the one who formed him :"
“ would you question me about the things coming
and command me about my sons and the works of my hands ?
12 i made the earth and created man on it .
"i stretched out the heavens with my own hands ,"
and i give orders to all their army . ”
"13 “ i have raised up a man in righteousness ,"
and i will make all his ways straight .
he is the one who will build my city
"and set my exiles free without a price or a bribe , ” says jehovah of armies ."
14 this is what jehovah says :
"“ the profit of egypt and the merchandise of e·thi·oʹpi·a and the sa·beʹans , tall of stature ,"
will come over to you and become yours .
they will walk behind you in chains .
they will come over and bow down to you .
"to you they will say in prayer , ‘ surely god is with you ,"
and there is no one else ; there is no other god . ’ ”
"15 truly you are a god who conceals himself ,"
"o god of israel , the savior ."
16 they will all be put to shame and be humiliated ;
the makers of idols will all go off in disgrace .
17 but israel will be saved by jehovah with an everlasting salvation .
you will not be put to shame or disgraced for all eternity .
"18 for this is what jehovah says ,"
"the creator of the heavens , the true god ,"
"the one who formed the earth , its maker who firmly established it ,"
"who did not create it simply for nothing , but formed it to be inhabited :"
"“ i am jehovah , and there is no one else ."
"19 i did not speak in a concealed place , in a land of darkness ;"
"i did not say to the offspring of jacob ,"
‘ seek me simply for nothing . ’
"i am jehovah , who speaks what is righteous and declares what is upright ."
20 gather together and come .
"approach together , you escapees from the nations ."
"they know nothing , those who carry around carved images"
and pray to a god that can not save them .
"21 make your report , present your case ."
let them consult together in unity .
who foretold this long ago
and declared it from times past ?
"is it not i , jehovah ?"
there is no other god but me ;
"a righteous god and a savior , there is none besides me ."
"22 turn to me and be saved , all the ends of the earth ,"
"for i am god , and there is no one else ."
23 by myself i have sworn ;
"the word has gone out of my mouth in righteousness ,"
and it will not return :
"to me every knee will bend ,"
every tongue will swear loyalty
"24 and say , ‘ surely in jehovah are true righteousness and strength ."
all those enraged against him will come before him in shame .
"25 in jehovah all the offspring of israel will prove to be right ,"
and in him they will make their boast . ’ ”
for the director . a melody of david .
"140 rescue me , o jehovah , from evil men ;"
"protect me from violent men ,"
2 those who scheme evil in their hearts
and stir up conflict all day long .
3 they sharpen their tongue like that of a serpent ;
venom of vipers is behind their lips . ( selah )
"4 protect me , o jehovah , from the hands of the wicked ;"
"safeguard me from violent men ,"
those who scheme to trip me .
5 the haughty ones hide a trap for me ;
with ropes they spread out a net beside the path .
they set snares for me . ( selah )
6 i say to jehovah : “ you are my god .
"listen , o jehovah , to my pleas for help . ”"
"7 o jehovah the sovereign lord , my strong savior ,"
you shield my head in the day of battle .
"8 do not grant , o jehovah , the desires of the wicked ."
"do not let their plots succeed , so that they are not exalted . ( selah )"
9 may the heads of those surrounding me
be covered with the evil spoken by their lips .
10 may burning coals rain down on them .
"may they be hurled into the fire ,"
"into deep pits , never to rise again ."
11 may the slanderer find no place on the earth .
may evil pursue men of violence and strike them down .
12 i know that jehovah will defend the lowly
and give justice to the poor .
13 surely the righteous will give thanks to your name ;
the upright will dwell before your face .
"51 “ listen to me , you who are pursuing righteousness ,"
you who are seeking jehovah .
look to the rock from which you were hewn
and to the quarry from which you were dug .
2 look to abraham your father
and to sarah who gave birth to you .
"for he was only one when i called him ,"
and i blessed him and made him many .
3 for jehovah will comfort zion .
"he will bring comfort to all her ruins ,"
and he will make her wilderness like eʹden
and her desert plain like the garden of jehovah .
"exultation and rejoicing will be found in her ,"
thanksgiving and melodious song .
"4 pay attention to me , o my people ,"
"and give ear to me , my nation ."
"for a law will go out from me ,"
and my justice i will establish as a light to the peoples .
5 my righteousness draws near .
"my salvation will go out ,"
and my arms will judge the peoples .
"in me the islands will hope ,"
and for my arm they will wait .
"6 raise your eyes to the heavens ,"
and look at the earth below .
for the heavens will disperse in fragments like smoke ;
"the earth will wear out like a garment ,"
and its inhabitants will die like gnats .
"but my salvation will be eternal ,"
and my righteousness will never fail .
"7 listen to me , you who know righteousness ,"
the people with my law in their heart .
"do not be afraid of the taunts of mortal men ,"
and do not be terrified because of their insults .
8 for a moth will eat them up just like a garment ;
the clothes moth will devour them like wool .
"but my righteousness will last forever ,"
and my salvation for all generations . ”
"9 awake ! awake ! clothe yourself with strength ,"
o arm of jehovah !
"awake as in the days of long ago , as in past generations ."
"was it not you who broke raʹhab to pieces ,"
who pierced the sea monster ?
"10 are you not the one who dried up the sea , the waters of the vast deep ?"
the one who made the depths of the sea a roadway for the repurchased ones to cross ?
11 the redeemed ones of jehovah will return .
"they will come to zion with a joyful cry ,"
and unending joy will crown them .
"exultation and rejoicing will be theirs ,"
and grief and sighing will flee away .
12 “ i myself am the one comforting you .
why should you be afraid of a mortal man who will die
and of a son of man who will wither like green grass ?
"13 why do you forget jehovah your maker ,"
the one who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundation of the earth ?
"and all day long you were in constant fear of the rage of the oppressor ,"
as though he were in a position to bring you to ruin .
"where , now , is the rage of the oppressor ?"
14 the one bent over in chains will soon be set free ;
"he will not die and go into the pit ,"
nor will his bread be lacking .
"15 but i am jehovah your god ,"
who stirs up the sea and makes its waves boisterous
—jehovah of armies is his name .
"16 i will put my words in your mouth ,"
"and with the shadow of my hand i will cover you ,"
in order to plant the heavens and to lay the foundation of the earth
"and to say to zion , ‘ you are my people . ’"
"17 awake ! awake ! rise up , o jerusalem ,"
you who have drunk from the hand of jehovah his cup of wrath .
you have drunk the goblet ;
you have drained out the cup causing staggering .
"18 not one of all the sons whom she bore is there to guide her ,"
and not one of all the sons whom she raised has taken hold of her hand .
19 these two things have befallen you .
who will sympathize with you ?
"destruction and devastation , hunger and sword !"
who will comfort you ?
20 your sons have fainted .
they lie down at every street corner
like wild sheep in the net .
"they are full of the wrath of jehovah , the rebuke of your god . ”"
"21 so please listen to this ,"
"o woman afflicted and drunk , though not with wine ."
"22 this is what your lord jehovah says , your god who defends his people :"
"“ look ! i will take from your hand the cup causing staggering ,"
"the goblet , my cup of wrath ;"
you will never drink it again .
"23 i will put it into the hand of your tormentors ,"
"those who said to you , ‘ bow down so that we may walk over you ! ’"
"so you made your back like the ground ,"
like a street for them to walk on . ”
20 then god spoke all these words :
"2 “ i am jehovah your god , who brought you out of the land of egypt , out of the house of slavery . 3 you must not have any other gods besides me ."
"4 “ you must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above or on the earth below or in the waters under the earth . 5 you must not bow down to them nor be enticed to serve them , for i , jehovah your god , am a god who requires exclusive devotion , bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons , upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation of those who hate me , 6 but showing loyal love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments ."
"7 “ you must not take up the name of jehovah your god in a worthless way , for jehovah will not leave unpunished the one who takes up his name in a worthless way ."
"8 “ remember the sabbath day to keep it sacred . 9 you are to labor and do all your work for six days , 10 but the seventh day is a sabbath to jehovah your god . you must not do any work , neither you nor your son nor your daughter nor your slave man nor your slave girl nor your domestic animal nor your foreign resident who is inside your settlements . 11 for in six days jehovah made the heavens and the earth , the sea , and all that is in them , and he began to rest on the seventh day . that is why jehovah blessed the sabbath day and made it sacred ."
"12 “ honor your father and your mother , so that you may live a long time in the land that jehovah your god is giving you ."
13 “ you must not murder .
14 “ you must not commit adultery .
15 “ you must not steal .
16 “ you must not testify falsely when you are a witness against your fellow man .
17 “ you must not desire your fellow man ’ s house . you must not desire your fellow man ’ s wife nor his slave man nor his slave girl nor his bull nor his donkey nor anything that belongs to your fellow man . ”
"18 now all the people were witnessing the thunder and lightning , the sound of the horn , and the mountain smoking ; and seeing this made them tremble and stand at a distance . 19 so they said to moses : “ you speak with us , and we will listen , but do not let god speak with us , for fear that we will die . ” 20 so moses said to the people : “ do not be afraid , for the true god has come to put you to the test , in order that the fear of him may continue with you so that you may not sin . ” 21 so the people kept standing at a distance , but moses went near to the dark cloud where the true god was ."
"22 then jehovah said to moses : “ this is what you are to say to the israelites , ‘ you have seen for yourselves that i spoke with you from heaven . 23 you must not make gods of silver alongside me , and you must not make gods of gold for yourselves . 24 an altar of earth you are to make for me , and you will sacrifice on it your burnt offerings , your communion sacrifices , your flock , and your herd . in every place where i cause my name to be remembered i will come to you and i will bless you . 25 if you make an altar of stones for me , you must not build it using stones cut with tools . for if you do use your chisel on it , you will profane it . 26 and you must not go up by steps to my altar , that your private parts may not be exposed upon it . ’"
"37 and king zed·e·kiʹah the son of jo·siʹah began to reign in place of co·niʹah the son of je·hoiʹa·kim , for king neb·u·chad·nezʹzar of babylon made him king in the land of judah . 2 but he and his servants and the people of the land did not listen to the words of jehovah spoken through jeremiah the prophet ."
"3 and king zed·e·kiʹah sent je·huʹcal the son of shel·e·miʹah and zeph·a·niʹah the son of ma·a·seiʹah the priest to jeremiah the prophet , saying : “ please pray in our behalf to jehovah our god . ” 4 jeremiah was moving about freely among the people , for they had not yet put him in prison . 5 now pharʹaoh ’ s army had set out from egypt , and the chal·deʹans who were besieging jerusalem heard the report about them . so they withdrew from against jerusalem . 6 then the word of jehovah came to jeremiah the prophet , saying : 7 “ this is what jehovah the god of israel says , ‘ this is what you should say to the king of judah , who sent you to me to inquire of me : “ look ! the army of pharʹaoh that is coming to assist you will have to go back to their land , egypt . 8 and the chal·deʹans will come back and fight against this city and capture it and burn it with fire . ” 9 this is what jehovah says , “ do not deceive yourselves by saying , ‘ the chal·deʹans will surely go away from against us , ’ because they will not go away . 10 even if yo"
"11 when the chal·deʹan army had withdrawn from against jerusalem because of pharʹaoh ’ s army , 12 jeremiah set out from jerusalem to the land of benjamin to receive his portion there among his people . 13 but when he reached the gate of benjamin , the officer in charge of the guard , whose name was i·riʹjah the son of shel·e·miʹah the son of han·a·niʹah , seized jeremiah the prophet and said : “ you are deserting to the chal·deʹans ! ” 14 but jeremiah said : “ it is not true ! i am not deserting to the chal·deʹans . ” but he did not listen to him . so i·riʹjah arrested jeremiah and brought him in to the princes . 15 the princes were furious with jeremiah , and they beat him and imprisoned him in the house of je·honʹa·than the secretary , which had been made into a prison . 16 jeremiah was put into the dungeon , into the vaulted rooms , and he remained there many days ."
"17 then king zed·e·kiʹah sent for him , and the king secretly questioned him in his house . he asked , “ is there any word from jehovah ? ” jeremiah said , “ there is ! ” and he continued , “ you will be given into the hand of the king of babylon ! ”"
"18 jeremiah also said to king zed·e·kiʹah : “ how have i sinned against you and against your servants and against this people , so that you have put me into the prison ? 19 where , now , are your prophets who prophesied to you , ‘ the king of babylon will not come against you and against this land ’ ? 20 now listen , please , o my lord the king . may you grant , please , my request for favor . do not send me back to the house of je·honʹa·than the secretary , or i will die there . ” 21 so king zed·e·kiʹah ordered that jeremiah be put in custody in the courtyard of the guard , and he was given a round loaf of bread daily from the street of the bakers until all the bread in the city was gone . and jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard ."
"6 “ come , and let us return to jehovah ,"
"for he has torn us to pieces , but he will heal us ."
"he struck us , but he will bind our wounds ."
2 he will revive us after two days .
"on the third day he will raise us up ,"
and we will live before him .
"3 we will know , we will earnestly seek to know jehovah ."
his going out is as certain as the dawn ;
"he will come to us like a pouring rain ,"
like a spring rain that saturates the earth . ”
"4 “ what should i do with you , eʹphra·im ?"
"what should i do with you , judah ?"
"for your loyal love is like the morning clouds ,"
like the dew that quickly vanishes .
5 that is why i will cut them down by means of the prophets ;
i will kill them with the words of my mouth .
and the judgments on you will shine as the light .
"6 for in loyal love i delight , not in sacrifice ,"
"and in the knowledge of god , rather than in whole burnt offerings ."
"7 but they , like mere men , have violated the covenant ."
there they have betrayed me .
"8 gilʹe·ad is a town of evildoers ,"
covered with footprints of blood .
9 the company of priests are like marauder bands lying in ambush for a man .
"they murder on the road at sheʹchem ,"
for their conduct is shameful .
10 i have seen a horrible thing in the house of israel .
there eʹphra·im practices prostitution ;
israel has defiled itself .
"11 furthermore , o judah , a harvest is set for you ,"
when i gather back the captives of my people . ”
12 “ eʹphra·im is feeding on wind .
he chases after the east wind all day long .
he multiplies lies and violence .
they make a covenant with as·syrʹi·a and take oil to egypt .
2 jehovah has a legal case against judah ;
"he will call for an accounting against jacob according to his ways ,"
and he will repay him according to his deeds .
"3 in the womb he seized his brother by the heel ,"
and with his vigor he contended with god .
4 he kept contending with an angel and prevailed .
he wept and begged for his favor . ”
"he found him at bethʹel , and there he spoke with us ,"
"5 jehovah the god of armies ,"
jehovah is his memorial name .
"6 “ so return to your god ,"
"maintain loyal love and justice ,"
and always hope in your god .
7 but in the hand of the tradesman are deceptive scales ;
he loves to defraud .
"8 eʹphra·im keeps saying , ‘ indeed , i have become rich ;"
i have found wealth .
"and in all my toil , they will not find anything wrong or sinful . ’"
9 but i am jehovah your god from the land of egypt .
i will again make you dwell in tents
as in the days of an appointed time .
"10 i spoke to the prophets ,"
"i multiplied their visions ,"
and i spoke parables through the prophets .
11 with gilʹe·ad there has been deception and untruth .
"in gilʹgal they have sacrificed bulls ,"
and their altars are like piles of stones in the furrows of the field .
12 jacob ran away to the territory of aʹram ;
"israel served there for a wife ,"
and for a wife he guarded sheep .
"13 by a prophet jehovah brought israel up from egypt ,"
and by a prophet he was guarded .
14 eʹphra·im has caused bitter offense ;
his bloodguilt remains on him ;
his lord will repay him for his reproach . ”
"3 the prayer of ha·bakʹkuk the prophet , in dirges :"

in the midst of the years bring it to life !
in the midst of the years make it known .
may you remember to show mercy during the turmoil .
"3 god came from teʹman ,"
the holy one from mount paʹran . ( selah )
his majesty covered the heavens ;
with his praise the earth was filled .
4 his brightness was like the light .
"two rays flashed from his hand ,"
where his strength was hidden .
"5 before him went pestilence ,"
and burning fever followed at his feet .
6 he stood still and shook the earth .
"with a look , he made nations leap ."
"the eternal mountains were smashed ,"
and the ancient hills bowed down .
the paths of long ago are his .
7 i saw trouble in the tents of cuʹshan .
the tent cloths of the land of midʹi·an trembled .
"8 is it against the rivers , o jehovah ,"
is it against the rivers that your anger is burning ?
or is your fury against the sea ?
for you rode on your horses ;
your chariots were victorious .
9 your bow is uncovered and ready .
the rods are assigned with an oath . ( selah )
you split the earth with rivers .
10 mountains writhed in pain at the sight of you .
a downpour of waters swept through .
the deep roared with its voice .
it lifted its hands high .
11 sun and moon stood still in their lofty abode .
your arrows went out like the light .
the lightning of your spear was brilliant .
12 you marched through the earth with indignation .
you trampled the nations in anger .
"13 you went out for the salvation of your people , to save your anointed one ."
you crushed the leader of the house of the wicked .
it was exposed from the foundation to the top . ( selah )
14 you pierced the head of his warriors with his own weapons
when they stormed out to scatter me .
they were overjoyed to devour an afflicted one in secret .
"15 through the sea you trod with your horses ,"
through the surging of vast waters .
16 i heard and i trembled within ;
at the sound my lips quivered .
rottenness entered my bones ;
my legs beneath me were shaking .
"but i quietly wait for the day of distress ,"
for it is coming upon the people who attack us .
"17 although the fig tree may not blossom ,"
and there may be no fruit on the vines ;

and there may be no cattle in the stalls ;
"18 yet , as for me , i will exult in jehovah ;"
i will be joyful in the god of my salvation .

and cause me to tread on high places .

"14 king hiʹram of tyre sent messengers to david , along with cedar timbers , stonemasons , and woodworkers to build a house for him . 2 and david knew that jehovah had firmly established him as king over israel , for his kingship was highly exalted for the sake of his people israel ."
"3 david took more wives in jerusalem , and david became father to more sons and daughters . 4 these are the names of the children born to him in jerusalem : sham·muʹa , shoʹbab , nathan , solʹo·mon , 5 ibʹhar , e·liʹshu·a , elʹpe·let , 6 noʹgah , neʹpheg , ja·phiʹa , 7 e·lishʹa·ma , be·e·liʹa·da , and e·liphʹe·let ."
"8 when the phi·lisʹtines heard that david had been anointed as king over all israel , all the phi·lisʹtines came up to search for david . when david heard about it , he went out against them . 9 then the phi·lisʹtines came in and kept making raids in the valley of rephʹa·im . 10 david inquired of god , saying : “ should i go up against the phi·lisʹtines ? will you give them into my hand ? ” at this jehovah said to him : “ go up , and i will surely give them into your hand . ” 11 so david went up to baʹal-pe·raʹzim , and he struck them down there . at that david said : “ the true god has broken through my enemies by my hand , like a breach made by waters . ” that is why they named that place baʹal-pe·raʹzim . 12 the phi·lisʹtines abandoned their gods there , and when david gave the order , these were burned in the fire ."
"13 later the phi·lisʹtines once again made a raid in the valley . 14 david again inquired of god , but the true god said to him : “ do not go directly up after them . instead , go around behind them , and come against them in front of the baʹca bushes . 15 and when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the baʹca bushes , launch your attack , for the true god will have gone out before you to strike down the army of the phi·lisʹtines . ” 16 so david did just as the true god commanded him , and they struck down the phi·lisʹtine army from gibʹe·on to geʹzer . 17 and david ’ s fame spread into all the lands , and jehovah put the dread of him upon all the nations ."
"9 he then called out in my ears with a loud voice , saying : “ summon those who will bring punishment on the city , each one with his weapon for destruction in his hand ! ”"
"2 i saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate that faces north , each with his weapon for smashing in his hand ; and there was one man among them clothed in linen , with a secretary ’ s inkhorn at his waist , and they came in and stood beside the copper altar ."
"3 then the glory of the god of israel rose from where it had rested above the cherubs and moved to the threshold of the doorway of the house , and he began calling out to the man who was clothed in linen , at whose waist was the secretary ’ s inkhorn . 4 jehovah said to him : “ go through the city , through jerusalem , and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who are sighing and groaning over all the detestable things that are being done in the city . ”"
"5 and to the others he said in my hearing : “ go through the city after him and strike . do not let your eye feel sorry , and do not feel any compassion . 6 old man , young man , virgin , little child , and women you should kill off completely . but do not go near to any man on whom there is the mark . you should start from my sanctuary . ” so they started with the elders who were in front of the house . 7 then he said to them : “ defile the house and fill the courtyards with the slain . go ! ” so they went out and struck down people in the city ."
"8 while they were striking them down , i alone was left , and i fell facedown and cried out : “ alas , o sovereign lord jehovah ! are you going to destroy all the remaining ones of israel while you pour out your rage on jerusalem ? ”"
"9 so he said to me : “ the error of the house of israel and judah is very , very great . the land is filled with bloodshed , and the city is full of corruption . for they say , ‘ jehovah has left the land , and jehovah is not seeing . ’ 10 but as for me , my eye will not feel sorry ; nor will i show compassion . the consequences of their way i will bring down on their own head . ”"
"11 then i saw the man clothed in linen with the inkhorn at his waist bringing back word , saying : “ i have done just as you have commanded me . ”"
"28 david then congregated all the princes of israel to jerusalem : the princes of the tribes , the chiefs of the divisions ministering to the king , the chiefs of thousands and the chiefs of hundreds , the chiefs of all the property and livestock of the king and of his sons , together with the court officials and every mighty and capable man . 2 then king david rose to his feet and said :"
"“ hear me , my brothers and my people . it was my heart ’ s desire to build a house as the resting-place for the ark of the covenant of jehovah and as the footstool of our god , and i made preparations to build . 3 but the true god told me , ‘ you will not build a house for my name , for you are a man of wars , and you have shed blood . ’ 4 however , jehovah the god of israel chose me out of all the house of my father to become king over israel forever , for he chose judah as leader and of the house of judah , my father ’ s house , and of my father ’ s sons , i was the one whom he approved , to make me king over all israel . 5 and of all my sons—for jehovah has given me many sons—he chose my son solʹo·mon to sit on the throne of the kingship of jehovah over israel ."
"6 “ he said to me , ‘ your son solʹo·mon is the one who will build my house and my courtyards , for i have chosen him as my son and i will become his father . 7 i will firmly establish his kingship forever if he resolutely observes my commandments and my judicial decisions , as he is now doing . ’ 8 so i say before the eyes of all israel , jehovah ’ s congregation , and in the ears of our god : carefully observe and search for all the commandments of jehovah your god , so that you may possess the good land and pass it on as a permanent inheritance to your sons after you ."
"9 “ and you , solʹo·mon my son , know the god of your father and serve him with a complete heart and with a delightful soul , for jehovah searches through all hearts , and he discerns every inclination of the thoughts . if you search for him , he will let himself be found by you , but if you leave him , he will reject you forever . 10 see , now , for jehovah has chosen you to build a house as a sanctuary . be courageous and go to work . ”"
"11 david then gave to his son solʹo·mon the architectural plan of the porch and of its houses , its storerooms , its roof chambers , its inner rooms , and the house of the propitiatory cover . 12 he gave him the architectural plan of everything that had been conveyed to him through inspiration for the courtyards of jehovah ’ s house , for all the dining rooms around it , for the treasuries of the house of the true god , and for the treasuries of the things made holy ; 13 also for the divisions of the priests and of the levites , for all the duties of the service of jehovah ’ s house , and for all the utensils of the service of jehovah ’ s house ; 14 also for the weight of the gold , the gold for all the utensils for the different services , the weight of all the utensils of silver , and for all the utensils for the different services ; 15 also the weight for the gold lampstands and their gold lamps , the weight of the different lampstands and their lamps , and the weight of the silver lampstands , for each lampstand and its lamps according"
"20 then david said to his son solʹo·mon : “ be courageous and strong and go to work . do not be afraid or be terrified , for jehovah god , my god , is with you . he will not desert you or abandon you , but he will be with you until all the work for the service of jehovah ’ s house is finished . 21 and here are the divisions of the priests and of the levites for all the service of the house of the true god . you have willing , skilled workers to perform every kind of service , as well as the princes and all the people who will carry out all your instructions . ”"
"21 the word of jehovah again came to me , saying : 2 “ son of man , turn your face toward jerusalem , and make a proclamation against the holy places , and prophesy against the land of israel . 3 say to the land of israel , ‘ this is what jehovah says : “ here i am against you , and i will bring my sword out of its sheath and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked . 4 because i will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked , my sword will be drawn from its sheath against all flesh , from south to north . 5 all people will have to know that i myself , jehovah , have drawn my sword from its sheath . it will not go back again . ” ’"
"6 “ and you , son of man , sigh while you tremble , yes , sigh bitterly before them . 7 and if they say to you , ‘ why are you sighing ? ’ you will say , ‘ because of a report . ’ for it will certainly come , and every heart will melt with fear and every hand will hang limp and every spirit will become dejected and every knee will drip with water . ‘ look ! it will certainly come—it will take place , ’ declares the sovereign lord jehovah . ”"
"8 the word of jehovah again came to me , saying : 9 “ son of man , prophesy and say , ‘ this is what jehovah says : “ say , ‘ a sword ! a sword is sharpened , and it is polished . 10 it is sharpened to inflict a great slaughter ; it is polished to flash like lightning . ’ ” ’ ”"
“ should we not rejoice ? ”
"“ ‘ will it reject the scepter of my own son , as it does every tree ?"
"11 “ ‘ it is given to be polished and to be wielded with the hand . this sword is sharpened and polished , to be put into the hand of an executioner ."
"12 “ ‘ cry out and wail , son of man , for it has come against my people ; it is against all the chieftains of israel . these will be victims of the sword along with my people . so strike your thigh in grief . 13 for an examination has been made , and what will happen if the sword rejects the scepter ? it will cease to exist , ’ declares the sovereign lord jehovah ."
"14 “ and you , son of man , prophesy and clap your hands and repeat ‘ a sword ! ’ three times . it is the sword of the slain victims , the sword of great slaughter , that surrounds them . 15 their hearts will melt with fear and many will fall at their city gates ; i will inflict a slaughter by the sword . yes , it flashes like lightning and is polished for a slaughter ! 16 cut sharply to the right ! swing to the left ! go wherever your blade is directed ! 17 i will also clap my hands and satisfy my rage . i myself , jehovah , have spoken . ”"
"18 and the word of jehovah again came to me , saying : 19 “ as for you , son of man , mark out two ways for the sword of the king of babylon to come . both of them will originate from the same land , and a signpost should be set up where the road branches off to the two cities . 20 you should mark out one way for the sword to come against rabʹbah of the amʹmon·ites , and the other way against fortified jerusalem in judah . 21 for the king of babylon stops to use divination at the fork in the road , where the two roads branch off . he shakes the arrows . he consults his idols ; he examines the liver . 22 the divination in his right hand is pointed toward jerusalem , to set up battering rams , to give the word for slaughter , to sound the battle cry , to set battering rams against the gates , to throw up a siege rampart , to build a siege wall . 23 but it will seem like false divination in the eyes of those who had sworn oaths to them . but he remembers their guilt and will capture them ."
"24 “ therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says : ‘ you have caused your own guilt to be remembered by exposing your transgressions and causing your sins to be seen in all your actions . now that you have been remembered , you will be taken by force . ’"
"25 “ but your day has come , o fatally wounded , wicked chieftain of israel , the time of your final punishment . 26 this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says : ‘ remove the turban , and take off the crown . this will not remain the same . raise up the low one , and bring low the high one . 27 a ruin , a ruin , a ruin i will make it . and it will not belong to anyone until the one who has the legal right comes , and i will give it to him . ’"
"28 “ and you , son of man , prophesy and say , ‘ this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says about the amʹmon·ites and about their insults . ’ say , ‘ a sword ! a sword is drawn for a slaughter ; it is polished to devour and to flash like lightning . 29 despite the false visions and lying divination about you , you will be piled up on the slain , the wicked men whose day has come , the time of their final punishment . 30 return it to its sheath . i will judge you in the place that you were created , in the land of your origin . 31 i will pour out my indignation on you . i will blow upon you with the fire of my fury , and i will hand you over to brutal men , the craftsmen of destruction . 32 you will become fuel for the fire ; your own blood will be shed in the land , and you will be remembered no more , for i myself , jehovah , have spoken . ’ ”"
"35 the word of jehovah again came to me , saying : 2 “ son of man , turn your face toward the mountainous region of seʹir , and prophesy against it . 3 say to it , ‘ this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says : “ here i am against you , o mountainous region of seʹir , and i will stretch out my hand against you and make you a desolate wasteland . 4 i will turn your cities into ruins , and you will become a desolate wasteland ; and you will have to know that i am jehovah . 5 for you showed unrelenting hostility , and you gave the israelites over to the sword at the time of their disaster , at the time of their final punishment . ” ’"
"6 “ ‘ therefore as surely as i am alive , ’ declares the sovereign lord jehovah , ‘ i will prepare you for bloodshed , and bloodshed will pursue you . since it was blood that you hated , bloodshed will pursue you . 7 i will make the mountainous region of seʹir a desolate wasteland , and i will cut off from it anyone passing through and anyone returning . 8 i will fill its mountains with the slain ; and those slain by the sword will fall on your hills , in your valleys , and in all your streams . 9 i will make you a perpetual desolation , and your cities will not be inhabited ; and you will have to know that i am jehovah . ’"
"10 “ because you said , ‘ these two nations and these two lands will become mine , and we will take possession of both , ’ even though jehovah himself was there , 11 ‘ therefore as surely as i am alive , ’ declares the sovereign lord jehovah , ‘ i will deal with you according to the same anger and jealousy that you displayed in your hatred toward them ; and i will make myself known among them when i judge you . 12 you will then have to know that i myself , jehovah , have heard all the insolent things you spoke against the mountains of israel when you said , “ they have been laid desolate and have been given to us to devour . ” 13 and you spoke arrogantly against me , and you multiplied your words against me . i heard it all . ’"
"14 “ this is what the sovereign lord jehovah says : ‘ the whole earth will rejoice when i will make you a desolate wasteland . 15 just as you rejoiced when the inheritance of the house of israel was laid desolate , that is how i will deal with you . you will become a desolate ruin , o mountainous region of seʹir , yes , all of eʹdom ; and they will have to know that i am jehovah . ’ ”"
"3 na·oʹmi , her mother-in-law , now said to her : “ my daughter , should i not look for a home for you , so that it may go well with you ? 2 is not boʹaz our relative ? he is the one whose young women you were with . tonight he is winnowing barley at the threshing floor . 3 so wash yourself and rub on some perfumed oil ; then dress up and go down to the threshing floor . do not make your presence known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking . 4 when he lies down , take note of the place where he lies down ; then go and uncover his feet and lie down . he will tell you what you should do . ”"
"5 at that she replied : “ all that you say to me i will do . ” 6 so she went down to the threshing floor and did all that her mother-in-law had instructed her to do . 7 meanwhile , boʹaz ate and drank and was feeling good at heart . then he went to lie down at the end of the grain heap . after that she quietly came and uncovered his feet and lay down . 8 at midnight the man began to shiver , and he leaned forward and saw a woman lying at his feet . 9 he said : “ who are you ? ” she replied : “ i am ruth , your servant . spread out your garment over your servant , for you are a repurchaser . ” 10 at that he said : “ may jehovah bless you , my daughter . you have shown your loyal love more in this last instance than in the first instance , by not going after the young men , whether poor or rich . 11 and now , my daughter , have no fear . i will do for you everything that you say , for everyone in the city knows that you are an excellent woman . 12 while it is true that i am a repurchaser , there is a repurchaser more closely related than i a"
"14 so she lay at his feet until the morning and then got up before it was light enough for anyone to be recognized . he then said : “ do not let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor . ” 15 he also said : “ bring the cloak that you are wearing , and hold it out . ” so she held it out , and he put six measures of barley in it and put it on her , after which he went into the city ."
"16 she went her way to her mother-in-law , who now said : “ how did it go for you , my daughter ? ” she told her everything that the man had done for her . 17 she added : “ he gave me these six measures of barley and said to me , ‘ do not go empty-handed to your mother-in-law . ’ ” 18 at that she said : “ sit here , my daughter , until you learn how the matter will turn out , for the man will not rest until he settles the matter today . ”"
"18 then all the assembly of the israelites congregated at shiʹloh , and they set up the tent of meeting there , as the land was now subdued before them . 2 but there were still seven tribes left of the israelites whose inheritance had not been allotted . 3 so joshua said to the israelites : “ how long will you put off going in to take possession of the land that jehovah the god of your forefathers has given you ? 4 give me three men from each tribe to send out ; they should go out and walk throughout the land and map it out according to their inheritance . then they should return to me . 5 they must apportion it among themselves into seven shares . judah will remain in his territory to the south , and the house of joseph will remain in their territory to the north . 6 as for you , map out the land into seven shares , and bring them here to me , and i will cast lots here for you before jehovah our god . 7 but the levites have no share among you , because the priesthood of jehovah is their inheritance ; and gad , reuʹben , and the half tribe"
"8 the men prepared to go , and joshua commanded those who were to map out the land : “ go and walk through the land and map it out and return to me , and i will cast lots for you here before jehovah in shiʹloh . ” 9 with that the men went and traveled through the land and mapped it out by cities into seven shares , recording it in a book . after that they returned to joshua at the camp in shiʹloh . 10 joshua then cast lots for them in shiʹloh before jehovah . there joshua apportioned the land to the israelites by their shares ."
"11 the lot came up for the tribe of benjamin by their families , and the territory of their lot was between the people of judah and the people of joseph . 12 on the north side , their boundary started at the jordan , and the boundary went up to the slope of jerʹi·cho on the north and went up on the mountain westward , and it extended to the wilderness of beth-aʹven . 13 and the boundary continued from there to luz , at the southern slope of luz , that is , bethʹel ; the boundary went down to atʹa·roth-adʹdar on the mountain that is south of lower beth-hoʹron . 14 and the boundary was marked at the western side and went around toward the south from the mountain that faces beth-hoʹron to the south ; it ended at kirʹi·ath-baʹal , that is , kirʹi·ath-jeʹa·rim , a city of judah . this is the western side ."
"15 the south side was from the extremity of kirʹi·ath-jeʹa·rim , and the boundary extended westward ; it went out to the spring of the waters of neph·toʹah . 16 the boundary went down to the extremity of the mountain that faces the valley of the son of hinʹnom , which is in the valley of rephʹa·im to the north , and it went down to the valley of hinʹnom , to the slope of the jebʹu·site on the south , and down to en-roʹgel . 17 and it was marked northward and extended to en-sheʹmesh and then out to gel·iʹloth , which is in front of the ascent of a·dumʹmim , and it went down to the stone of boʹhan the son of reuʹben . 18 and it continued to the northern slope in front of the arʹa·bah and went down to the arʹa·bah . 19 and the boundary continued to the northern slope of beth-hogʹlah , and the boundary ended at the northern bay of the salt sea at the southern end of the jordan . this was the southern boundary . 20 and the jordan served as its boundary on the eastern side . this was the inheritance of the descendants of benjamin by their famili"
"21 and the cities of the tribe of benjamin by their families were : jerʹi·cho , beth-hogʹlah , eʹmek-keʹziz , 22 beth-arʹa·bah , zem·a·raʹim , bethʹel , 23 avʹvim , paʹrah , ophʹrah , 24 cheʹphar-amʹmo·ni , ophʹni , and geʹba—12 cities and their settlements ."
"25 gibʹe·on , raʹmah , be·erʹoth , 26 mizʹpeh , che·phiʹrah , moʹzah , 27 reʹkem , irʹpe·el , tarʹa·lah , 28 zeʹlah , ha-eʹleph , je·buʹsi , that is , jerusalem , gibʹe·ah , and kirʹi·ath—14 cities and their settlements ."
this was the inheritance of the descendants of benjamin by their families .
"6 it was then that king da·riʹus issued an order , and they made an investigation in the archives where the treasures were deposited in babylon . 2 and a scroll was found in the citadel at ec·batʹa·na , in the province of meʹdi·a , and the following memorandum was written on it :"
"3 “ in the first year of king cyrus , king cyrus issued an order concerning the house of god in jerusalem : ‘ let the house be rebuilt as the place where they are to offer sacrifices , and its foundations are to be set in place ; its height is to be 60 cubits , its width 60 cubits , 4 with three layers of large stones rolled into place and one layer of timbers ; and let the expense be paid from the king ’ s house . 5 also , let the gold and silver vessels of the house of god that neb·u·chad·nezʹzar took out of the temple that was in jerusalem and brought to babylon be returned , so that they may be put in their place in the temple in jerusalem and be deposited in the house of god . ’"
"6 “ so now tatʹte·nai the governor of the region beyond the river , sheʹthar-bozʹe·nai , and your colleagues , the lesser governors of the region beyond the river—stay away from there . 7 do not interfere with the work on that house of god . the governor of the jews and the elders of the jews will rebuild that house of god in its former place . 8 furthermore , i am issuing an order as to what you are to do for these elders of the jews for rebuilding that house of god : from the royal treasury , from the tax collected in the region beyond the river , the expenses are to be promptly given to these men to continue without interruption . 9 and whatever is needed—young bulls as well as rams and lambs for the burnt offerings to the god of heaven , wheat , salt , wine , and oil , just as the priests who are in jerusalem say—is to be given them continually day by day without fail , 10 so that they may continually present offerings that please the god of the heavens and pray for the life of the king and his sons . 11 i have also issued an order tha"
"13 then tatʹte·nai the governor of the region beyond the river , sheʹthar-bozʹe·nai , and their colleagues promptly carried out everything that king da·riʹus had ordered . 14 and the elders of the jews continued building and making progress , urged on by the prophesying of hagʹgai the prophet and zech·a·riʹah the grandson of idʹdo ; they finished building it by the order of the god of israel and by the order of cyrus and da·riʹus and king ar·ta·xerxʹes of persia . 15 they completed the house by the third day of the month of aʹdar , in the sixth year of the reign of king da·riʹus ."
"16 then the israelites , the priests , the levites , and the rest of the former exiles held the inauguration of this house of god with joy . 17 and they presented for the inauguration of this house of god 100 bulls , 200 rams , 400 lambs , and as a sin offering for all israel 12 male goats , corresponding to the number of the tribes of israel . 18 and they appointed the priests in their groups and the levites in their divisions for the service of god in jerusalem , according to what is written in the book of moses ."
"19 and the former exiles held the passover on the 14th day of the first month . 20 the priests and the levites , without exception , had cleansed themselves , so they were all clean ; they slaughtered the passover sacrifice for all the former exiles , for their fellow priests , and for themselves . 21 then the israelites who had returned from the exile ate of it , along with everyone who had joined them and had separated himself from the uncleanness of the nations of the land to worship jehovah the god of israel . 22 they also joyfully held the festival of unleavened bread for seven days , for jehovah caused them to rejoice and he had made the heart of the king of as·syrʹi·a favorable toward them , so that he supported them in the work of the house of the true god , the god of israel ."
"18 after he said these things , jesus went out with his disciples across the kidʹron valley to where there was a garden , and he and his disciples went into it . 2 now judas , his betrayer , also knew the place , because jesus had often met there with his disciples . 3 so judas brought the detachment of soldiers and officers of the chief priests and of the pharisees and came there with torches and lamps and weapons . 4 then jesus , knowing all the things that were going to happen to him , stepped forward and said to them : “ whom are you looking for ? ” 5 they answered him : “ jesus the naz·a·reneʹ . ” he said to them : “ i am he . ” now judas , his betrayer , was also standing with them ."
"6 however , when jesus said to them , “ i am he , ” they drew back and fell to the ground . 7 so he asked them again : “ whom are you looking for ? ” they said : “ jesus the naz·a·reneʹ . ” 8 jesus answered : “ i told you that i am he . so if you are looking for me , let these men go . ” 9 this was to fulfill what he had said : “ of those whom you have given me , i have not lost a single one . ”"
"10 then simon peter , who had a sword , drew it and struck the slave of the high priest , cutting off his right ear . the name of the slave was malchus . 11 jesus , however , said to peter : “ put the sword into its sheath . should i not drink the cup that the father has given me ? ”"
"12 then the soldiers and the military commander and the officers of the jews seized jesus and bound him . 13 they led him first to anʹnas , for he was the father-in-law of caʹia·phas , who was high priest that year . 14 caʹia·phas was , in fact , the one who had advised the jews that it was to their benefit for one man to die in behalf of the people ."
"15 now simon peter , as well as another disciple , was following jesus . that disciple was known to the high priest , and he went with jesus into the courtyard of the high priest , 16 but peter was standing outside at the door . so the other disciple , who was known to the high priest , went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought peter in . 17 the servant girl who was the doorkeeper then said to peter : “ you are not also one of this man ’ s disciples , are you ? ” he said : “ i am not . ” 18 now the slaves and the officers were standing around a charcoal fire they had made , because it was cold and they were warming themselves . peter also was standing with them and warming himself ."
"19 so the chief priest questioned jesus about his disciples and about his teaching . 20 jesus answered him : “ i have spoken to the world publicly . i always taught in a synagogue and in the temple , where all the jews come together , and i said nothing in secret . 21 why do you question me ? question those who have heard what i told them . see ! these know what i said . ” 22 after he said these things , one of the officers who was standing by gave jesus a slap in the face and said : “ is that the way you answer the chief priest ? ” 23 jesus answered him : “ if i said something wrong , bear witness about the wrong ; but if what i said was right , why do you hit me ? ” 24 then anʹnas sent him away bound to caʹia·phas the high priest ."
"25 now simon peter was standing there warming himself . then they said to him : “ you are not also one of his disciples , are you ? ” he denied it and said : “ i am not . ” 26 one of the slaves of the high priest , who was a relative of the man whose ear peter had cut off , said : “ i saw you in the garden with him , did i not ? ” 27 however , peter denied it again , and immediately a rooster crowed ."
"28 then they led jesus from caʹia·phas to the governor ’ s residence . it was now early in the morning . but they themselves did not enter into the governor ’ s residence , so that they would not get defiled but could eat the passover . 29 so pilate came outside to them and said : “ what accusation do you bring against this man ? ” 30 they answered him : “ if this man were not a wrongdoer , we would not have handed him over to you . ” 31 so pilate said to them : “ take him yourselves and judge him according to your law . ” the jews said to him : “ it is not lawful for us to kill anyone . ” 32 this was to fulfill the word that jesus had spoken to indicate what sort of death he was about to die ."
"33 so pilate entered the governor ’ s residence again and called jesus and said to him : “ are you the king of the jews ? ” 34 jesus answered : “ are you asking this of your own originality , or did others tell you about me ? ” 35 pilate replied : “ i am not a jew , am i ? your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me . what did you do ? ” 36 jesus answered : “ my kingdom is no part of this world . if my kingdom were part of this world , my attendants would have fought that i should not be handed over to the jews . but as it is , my kingdom is not from this source . ” 37 so pilate said to him : “ well , then , are you a king ? ” jesus answered : “ you yourself are saying that i am a king . for this i have been born , and for this i have come into the world , that i should bear witness to the truth . everyone who is on the side of the truth listens to my voice . ” 38 pilate said to him : “ what is truth ? ”"
"after saying this , he went out again to the jews and said to them : “ i find no fault in him . 39 moreover , you have a custom that i should release a man to you at the passover . so do you want me to release to you the king of the jews ? ” 40 again they shouted : “ not this man , but bar·abʹbas ! ” now bar·abʹbas was a robber ."
"5 “ now you are slashing yourself ,"
o daughter under attack ;
a siege is laid against us .
with a rod they strike the judge of israel on the cheek .

11 i will destroy the cities of your land
and tear down all your fortified places .
"12 i will put an end to the sorcery you practice ,"
and no one practicing magic will remain among you .

"24 joshua then assembled all the tribes of israel together at sheʹchem and summoned the elders of israel , its heads , its judges , and its officers , and they stood before the true god . 2 joshua said to all the people : “ this is what jehovah the god of israel says , ‘ it was on the other side of the river that your forefathers lived a long time ago—teʹrah the father of abraham and the father of naʹhor—and they used to serve other gods ."
"3 “ ‘ in time i took your forefather abraham from the other side of the river and had him walk through all the land of caʹnaan and made his offspring many . i gave him isaac ; 4 then to isaac i gave jacob and eʹsau . later to eʹsau i gave mount seʹir as his possession ; and jacob and his sons went down to egypt . 5 i later sent moses and aaron , and i plagued egypt with what i did among them , and then i brought you out . 6 when i was bringing your fathers out of egypt and you came to the sea , the egyptians were chasing after your fathers with war chariots and cavalrymen as far as the red sea . 7 they began to cry out to jehovah , so he placed a darkness between you and the egyptians and brought the sea over them and covered them , and your own eyes saw what i did in egypt . then you dwelled in the wilderness many years ."
"8 “ ‘ and i brought you to the land of the amʹor·ites who were dwelling on the other side of the jordan , and they fought against you . but i gave them into your hand so that you could take possession of their land , and i annihilated them from before you . 9 then baʹlak son of zipʹpor , the king of moʹab , rose up and fought against israel . so he summoned baʹlaam the son of beʹor to curse you . 10 but i would not listen to baʹlaam . so he blessed you repeatedly , and i rescued you from his hand ."
"11 “ ‘ then you crossed the jordan and came to jerʹi·cho . and the leaders of jerʹi·cho , the amʹor·ites , the perʹiz·zites , the caʹnaan·ites , the hitʹtites , the girʹga·shites , the hiʹvites , and the jebʹu·sites fought against you , but i gave them into your hand . 12 so i sent the feeling of dejection ahead of you , and it drove them out from before you—two kings of the amʹor·ites . it was not by your sword and not by your bow . 13 thus i gave you a land for which you had not toiled and cities that you had not built , and you settled in them . you are eating from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant . ’"
"14 “ therefore , fear jehovah and serve him with integrity and faithfulness , and remove the gods that your forefathers served on the other side of the river and in egypt , and serve jehovah . 15 now if it seems bad to you to serve jehovah , choose for yourselves today whom you will serve , whether the gods that your forefathers served on the other side of the river or the gods of the amʹor·ites in whose land you are dwelling . but as for me and my household , we will serve jehovah . ”"
"16 at this the people answered : “ it is unthinkable for us to abandon jehovah and to serve other gods . 17 it is jehovah our god who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of egypt , out of the house of slavery , and who performed these great signs before our eyes and who kept guarding us the entire way in which we walked and among all the peoples through whom we passed . 18 jehovah drove out all the peoples , including the amʹor·ites , who lived in the land before us . therefore , we too will serve jehovah , because he is our god . ”"
"19 then joshua said to the people : “ you are not able to serve jehovah , for he is a holy god ; he is a god who requires exclusive devotion . he will not pardon your transgressions and your sins . 20 if you abandon jehovah and serve foreign gods , he will also turn against you and exterminate you after doing good for you . ”"
"21 but the people said to joshua : “ no , but we will serve jehovah ! ” 22 so joshua said to the people : “ you are witnesses against yourselves that of your own accord , you have chosen for yourselves to serve jehovah . ” to this they said : “ we are witnesses . ”"
"23 “ therefore , remove the foreign gods that are among you , and incline your hearts to jehovah the god of israel . ” 24 the people said to joshua : “ we will serve jehovah our god , and we will obey his voice ! ”"
25 so joshua made a covenant with the people on that day and established a regulation and a ruling for them in sheʹchem . 26 then joshua wrote these words in the book of god ’ s law and took a great stone and set it up under the large tree that is by the sanctuary of jehovah .
"27 joshua went on to say to all the people : “ look ! this stone will serve as a witness against us , because it has heard everything jehovah said to us , and it will serve as a witness against you , so that you may not deny your god . ” 28 with that joshua sent the people away , each one to his inheritance ."
"29 after these things , joshua the son of nun , the servant of jehovah , died at the age of 110 . 30 so they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in timʹnath-seʹrah , which is in the mountainous region of eʹphra·im , north of mount gaʹash . 31 israel continued to serve jehovah all the days of joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived joshua and who had known all of jehovah ’ s deeds in behalf of israel ."
"32 the bones of joseph , which the israelites had brought up out of egypt , were buried in sheʹchem in the portion of the field that jacob had acquired from the sons of haʹmor , sheʹchem ’ s father , for 100 pieces of money ; and it became the inheritance of the sons of joseph ."
"33 also , el·e·aʹzar the son of aaron died . so they buried him in the hill of phinʹe·has his son , which had been given to him in the mountainous region of eʹphra·im ."
"42 when jacob learned that there was grain in egypt , he said to his sons : “ why do you just keep looking at one another ? ” 2 he added : “ i have heard that there is grain in egypt . go down there and buy some for us , so that we may stay alive and not die . ” 3 so ten of joseph ’ s brothers went down to buy grain from egypt . 4 but jacob did not send benjamin , joseph ’ s brother , with his other brothers , for he said : “ perhaps a fatal accident may befall him . ”"
"5 so israel ’ s sons came along with the others who were coming to buy , because the famine had extended to the land of caʹnaan . 6 joseph was the man in authority over the land , and he was the one who sold grain to all the people of the earth . so joseph ’ s brothers came and bowed low to him with their faces to the ground . 7 when joseph saw his brothers , he immediately recognized them , but he concealed his identity from them . so he spoke harshly with them and said : “ where have you come from ? ” to which they said : “ from the land of caʹnaan to buy food . ”"
"8 thus joseph recognized his brothers , but they did not recognize him . 9 joseph immediately remembered the dreams that he had dreamed about them , and he said to them : “ you are spies ! you have come to see the vulnerable areas of the land ! ” 10 then they said to him : “ no , my lord , but your servants have come to buy food . 11 we are all sons of but one man . we are upright men . your servants do not act as spies . ” 12 but he said to them : “ not so ! you have come to see the vulnerable areas of the land ! ” 13 at this they said : “ your servants are 12 brothers . we are the sons of but one man in the land of caʹnaan , and the youngest is now with our father , whereas the other one is no more . ”"
"14 however , joseph said to them : “ it is just as i said to you— ‘ you are spies ! ’ 15 by this you will be tested : as surely as pharʹaoh lives , you will not leave this place until your youngest brother comes here . 16 send one of you to bring your brother while you remain in bondage . in this way , your words may be tested out to see if you are telling the truth . and if not , then , as surely as pharʹaoh lives , you are spies . ” 17 with that he put them together in custody for three days ."
"18 joseph said to them on the third day : “ do this and live , for i fear god . 19 if you are upright , let one of your brothers remain in bondage in your house of custody , but the rest of you may go and take grain to alleviate the famine in your households . 20 then bring your youngest brother to me , so that your words will be found trustworthy and you will not die . ” and they did so ."
"21 and they said to one another : “ we are surely being punished on account of our brother , because we saw his distress when he begged us to show compassion , but we did not listen . that is why this distress has come upon us . ” 22 then reuʹben answered them : “ did i not say to you , ‘ do not sin against the child , ’ but you would not listen ? now his blood is certainly being asked back . ” 23 but they did not know that joseph understood , for there was an interpreter between them . 24 so he turned away from them and began to weep . when he returned and spoke to them again , he took simʹe·on from them and bound him before their eyes . 25 joseph then gave the command to fill up their bags with grain and to return each man ’ s money to his own sack and to give them provisions for the journey . this was done for them ."
"26 so they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left from there . 27 when one of them opened his sack to give fodder to his donkey at the lodging place , he saw his money there in the mouth of his bag . 28 at that he said to his brothers : “ my money has been returned , and now here it is in my bag ! ” then their hearts sank , and trembling , they turned to one another and said : “ what is this that god has done to us ? ”"
"29 when they came to jacob their father in the land of caʹnaan , they told him all the things that had befallen them , saying : 30 “ the man who is the lord of the country spoke harshly with us and accused us of spying on the country . 31 but we said to him , ‘ we are upright men . we are not spies . 32 we are 12 brothers , the sons of our father . one is no more , and the youngest is now with our father in the land of caʹnaan . ’ 33 but the man who is the lord of the country said to us , ‘ by this i will know that you are upright : leave one of your brothers with me . then take something to alleviate the famine in your households and go . 34 and bring your youngest brother to me , so that i may know that you are not spies but upright men . i will then give your brother back to you , and you may carry on trade in the land . ’ ”"
"35 as they were emptying their sacks , here was each one ’ s bag of money in his sack . when they and their father saw their bags of money , they became afraid . 36 jacob their father exclaimed to them : “ it is i you have bereaved ! joseph is no more , and simʹe·on is no more , and you are going to take benjamin ! it is upon me that all these things have come ! ” 37 but reuʹben said to his father : “ you may put to death my own two sons if i do not bring him back to you . give him over to my care , and i will return him to you . ” 38 however , he said : “ my son will not go down with you , because his brother is dead and he alone is left . if a fatal accident should befall him on the journey you would make , then you would certainly bring down my gray hairs to the grave in grief . ”"

"4 finally , brothers , just as you received instruction from us on how you should walk in order to please god , just as you are in fact walking , we request you and appeal to you by the lord jesus to keep doing it more fully . 2 for you know the instructions we gave you through the lord jesus ."
"3 for this is the will of god , that you should be holy and abstain from sexual immorality . 4 each one of you should know how to control his own body in holiness and honor , 5 not with greedy , uncontrolled sexual passion like the nations have that do not know god . 6 no one should go beyond proper limits and take advantage of his brother in this matter , because jehovah exacts punishment for all these things , just as we told you previously and also strongly warned you . 7 for god has called us , not for uncleanness , but for holiness . 8 so , then , the man who disregards this is disregarding , not man , but god , who gives you his holy spirit ."
"9 however , concerning brotherly love , you do not need us to write to you , for you yourselves are taught by god to love one another . 10 in fact , you are doing so toward all the brothers in all of mac·e·doʹni·a . but we urge you , brothers , to go on doing so in fuller measure . 11 make it your aim to live quietly and to mind your own business and to work with your hands , just as we instructed you , 12 so that you may walk decently in the eyes of people outside and not need anything ."
"13 moreover , brothers , we do not want you to be ignorant about those who are sleeping in death , so that you may not sorrow as the rest do who have no hope . 14 for if we have faith that jesus died and rose again , so too god will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in death through jesus . 15 for this is what we tell you by jehovah ’ s word , that we the living who survive to the presence of the lord will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep in death ; 16 because the lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call , with an archangel ’ s voice and with god ’ s trumpet , and those who are dead in union with christ will rise first . 17 afterward we the living who are surviving will , together with them , be caught away in clouds to meet the lord in the air ; and thus we will always be with the lord . 18 so keep comforting one another with these words ."
"4 when morʹde·cai learned of everything that had been done , he ripped his garments apart and put on sackcloth and ashes . then he went out into the middle of the city , crying out loudly and bitterly . 2 he went only as far as the king ’ s gate , for no one was to enter the king ’ s gate wearing sackcloth . 3 and in every province where the king ’ s word and his decree reached , there was great mourning among the jews , along with fasting and weeping and wailing . many were lying down in sackcloth and ashes . 4 when esther ’ s female attendants and her eunuchs came in and told her , the queen was deeply distressed . then she sent garments for morʹde·cai to wear instead of his sackcloth , but he refused them . 5 at this esther summoned haʹthach , one of the king ’ s eunuchs , whom he had appointed to serve her , and she ordered him to find out from morʹde·cai what this meant and what was happening ."
6 so haʹthach went out to morʹde·cai in the public square of the city in front of the king ’ s gate . 7 morʹde·cai told him about everything that had happened to him and the exact amount of money that haʹman had promised to pay to the king ’ s treasury for the jews to be destroyed . 8 he also gave him a copy of the written decree that had been issued in shuʹshan for their annihilation . he was to show it to esther and explain it to her and instruct her to go in to the king to beg for his favor and to plead directly with him in behalf of her people .
"9 haʹthach came back and told esther what morʹde·cai had said . 10 esther replied to haʹthach with instructions to tell morʹde·cai : 11 “ all the king ’ s servants and the people of the king ’ s provinces are aware that if any man or woman goes into the king ’ s inner courtyard without being summoned , there is only one law that applies : he is to be put to death ; he may live only if the king holds out to him the golden scepter . and i have not been summoned to the king now for 30 days . ”"
"12 when morʹde·cai was told what esther had said , 13 he replied to esther : “ do not imagine that because you are in the king ’ s household you are any more likely to escape than all the other jews . 14 for if you remain silent at this time , relief and deliverance will come to the jews from another source , but you and your father ’ s house will perish . and who knows whether it is for a time like this that you have attained to your royal status ? ”"
"15 then esther replied to morʹde·cai : 16 “ go , gather all the jews who are found in shuʹshan and fast in my behalf . do not eat or drink for three days , night and day . i along with my female attendants will also fast . i will go in to the king , which is against the law , and if i am to perish , i will perish . ” 17 so morʹde·cai went his way and did all that esther had instructed him to do ."
10 king a·has·u·eʹrus imposed forced labor on the land and the islands of the sea .
"2 and all his powerful and mighty accomplishments , as well as the detailed account of morʹde·cai ’ s greatness to which the king exalted him , are they not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of meʹdi·a and persia ? 3 for morʹde·cai the jew was second only to king a·has·u·eʹrus . he was great among the jews and respected by the multitude of his brothers , working for the good of his people and advocating the welfare of all their descendants ."
"26 after the scourge , jehovah said to moses and el·e·aʹzar the son of aaron the priest : 2 “ take a census of the whole assembly of the israelites from 20 years of age and up , by their paternal houses , counting all those who can serve in the army in israel . ” 3 so moses and el·e·aʹzar the priest spoke with them in the desert plains of moʹab by the jordan at jerʹi·cho , saying : 4 “ take a census of them from the age of 20 years and up , just as jehovah commanded moses . ”"
"now the sons of israel who went out of the land of egypt were : 5 reuʹben , israel ’ s firstborn ; reuʹben ’ s sons were : of haʹnoch , the family of the haʹnoch·ites ; of palʹlu , the family of the palʹlu·ites ; 6 of hezʹron , the family of the hezʹron·ites ; of carʹmi , the family of the carʹmites . 7 these were the families of the reuʹben·ites , and their registered ones amounted to 43 ,730 ."
"8 the son of palʹlu was e·liʹab . 9 and the sons of e·liʹab were nemʹu·el , daʹthan , and a·biʹram . this daʹthan and a·biʹram were chosen ones of the assembly who fought against moses and aaron along with korʹah ’ s group when they fought against jehovah ."
"10 then the earth opened and swallowed them up . as for korʹah , he died with his supporters when the fire consumed 250 men . and they became a warning example . 11 however , the sons of korʹah did not die ."

"62 the total of those registered was 23 ,000 , all males from a month old and up . for they were not registered among the israelites , because no inheritance was to be given to them among the israelites ."
63 these were the ones registered by moses and el·e·aʹzar the priest when they registered the israelites in the desert plains of moʹab by the jordan at jerʹi·cho . 64 but among them there was no one who had been registered by moses and aaron the priest in the census of the israelites taken in the wilderness of siʹnai . 65 for jehovah had said concerning them : “ they will die without fail in the wilderness . ” so there was not a man left of them except caʹleb the son of je·phunʹneh and joshua the son of nun .
"32 now the sons of reuʹben and the sons of gad had very large quantities of livestock , and they saw that the lands of jaʹzer and gilʹe·ad were a good region for livestock . 2 so the sons of gad and the sons of reuʹben approached moses , el·e·aʹzar the priest , and the chieftains of the assembly and said : 3 “ atʹa·roth , diʹbon , jaʹzer , nimʹrah , heshʹbon , e·le·aʹleh , seʹbam , neʹbo , and beʹon , 4 the land that jehovah defeated before the assembly of israel , is a good land for livestock , and your servants have much livestock . ” 5 they continued : “ if we have found favor in your eyes , let this be the land given to your servants as a possession . do not make us cross the jordan . ”"
"6 then moses said to the sons of gad and the sons of reuʹben : “ are your brothers to go to war while you yourselves keep dwelling here ? 7 why should you discourage the people of israel from crossing into the land that jehovah is certain to give them ? 8 that is what your fathers did when i sent them from kaʹdesh-barʹne·a to see the land . 9 when they went up to the valley of eshʹcol and saw the land , they discouraged the people of israel from going into the land that jehovah was to give them . 10 jehovah ’ s anger blazed on that day so that he swore : 11 ‘ the men who came up out of egypt from 20 years old and up will not see the land of which i have sworn to abraham , isaac , and jacob , because they have not followed me wholeheartedly— 12 except caʹleb the son of je·phunʹneh the kenʹiz·zite and joshua the son of nun , because they have followed jehovah wholeheartedly . ’ 13 so jehovah ’ s anger blazed against israel and he made them wander about in the wilderness for 40 years , until all the generation that was doing evil in the eyes"
"16 they later approached him and said : “ let us build here stone pens for our livestock and cities for our children . 17 but we will continue ready for battle and will go before the israelites until we have brought them to their place , while our children will dwell in the fortified cities , safe from the inhabitants of the land . 18 we will not return to our houses until each of the israelites has received his land as an inheritance . 19 for we will not receive an inheritance with them on the other side of the jordan and beyond , because we have received our inheritance on the east side of the jordan . ”"
"20 moses replied to them : “ if you will do this : take up arms before jehovah for the war ; 21 and if every one of you takes up arms and crosses the jordan before jehovah as he drives away his enemies from before him 22 until the land is subdued before jehovah , afterward you may return and be free from guilt before jehovah and israel . then this land will become your possession before jehovah . 23 but if you do not do this , you will have sinned against jehovah . in that case , know that your sin will catch up with you . 24 so you may build cities for your children and pens for your flocks , but you must do what you have promised . ”"
"25 the sons of gad and the sons of reuʹben said this to moses : “ your servants will do just as my lord is commanding . 26 our children , our wives , our livestock , and all our domestic animals will stay there in the cities of gilʹe·ad , 27 but your servants will cross over , every man armed for battle to wage war before jehovah , just as my lord is speaking . ”"
"28 so moses gave a command concerning them to el·e·aʹzar the priest , to joshua the son of nun , and to the heads of the paternal houses of the tribes of israel . 29 moses said to them : “ if the sons of gad and the sons of reuʹben cross over the jordan with you , every man armed for the war before jehovah , and the land is subdued before you , you will then give them the land of gilʹe·ad as a possession . 30 but if they do not take up arms and cross over with you , they will then settle among you in the land of caʹnaan . ”"
"31 to this the sons of gad and the sons of reuʹben answered : “ what jehovah has spoken to your servants is what we will do . 32 we will take up arms and cross over before jehovah to the land of caʹnaan , but the possession we are to inherit will be on this side of the jordan . ” 33 so moses gave to them—to the sons of gad , the sons of reuʹben , and to the half tribe of ma·nasʹseh the son of joseph—the kingdom of siʹhon the king of the amʹor·ites and the kingdom of og the king of baʹshan , the land belonging to its cities in those territories , and the cities of the surrounding land ."
"34 and the sons of gad built diʹbon , atʹa·roth , a·roʹer , 35 atʹroth-shoʹphan , jaʹzer , jogʹbe·hah , 36 beth-nimʹrah , and beth-haʹran , fortified cities , and they built stone pens for the flocks . 37 and the sons of reuʹben built heshʹbon , e·le·aʹleh , kir·i·a·thaʹim , 38 neʹbo , and baʹal-meʹon—their names being changed—and sibʹmah ; and they began to rename the cities that they rebuilt ."
"39 the sons of maʹchir the son of ma·nasʹseh marched against gilʹe·ad and captured it and drove away the amʹor·ites who were in it . 40 so moses gave gilʹe·ad to maʹchir the son of ma·nasʹseh , and he began dwelling in it . 41 and jaʹir the son of ma·nasʹseh marched against them and captured their tent villages , and he began to call them havʹvoth-jaʹir . 42 and noʹbah marched against and captured keʹnath and its dependent towns , and he began to call it noʹbah by his own name ."
