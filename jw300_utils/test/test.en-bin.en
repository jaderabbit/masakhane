As we do so , meditate on how you personally can deepen your love for these spiritual treasures .
Read Matthew 13 : 45 , 46 .
Can you imagine how precious that pearl was to him ?
What is the lesson for us ?
( Read Mark 10 : 28 - 30 . )
( a ) Why did the apostle Paul describe our ministry as a “ treasure in earthen vessels ” ?
( Read Romans 1 : 14 , 15 ; 2 Timothy 4 : 2 . )
Some of them serve as Bethelites , pioneers , and elders .
Irene says , “ When I think of other goals I could have pursued , I can’t imagine one that would have brought me more joy . ”
( See paragraphs 11 , 12 )
But what will we teach to others ?
Consider another treasure from God .
13 , 14 .
What is the “ treasure store ” that Jesus referred to at Matthew 13 : 52 , and how do we fill it ?
Jehovah is the God of truth .
( Read Matthew 13 : 52 . )
( Read Proverbs 2 : 4 - 7 . )
How do we do that ?
17 , 18 .
How can holy spirit help us ?
Consider the experience of a brother named Peter .
To test Peter , the rabbi asked , “ So , my boy , what language was the book of Daniel written in ? ”
As you do this , you will build up “ treasure in the heavens , where no thief gets near and no moth consumes .
For where your treasure is , there your hearts will be also . ” ​ — Luke 12 : 33 , 34 .
“ I had trouble getting along with a brother who worked with me .
Once when we were yelling at each other , two people came in and witnessed our blowup . ” ​ — CHRIS .
“ A sister with whom I often preached suddenly ended our arrangements for the ministry .
I had no idea why . ” ​ — JANET .
“ I was on a three - person phone call .
One of the others said good - bye , and I thought he was off the line .
I then said unkind things about him to the other person on the phone , but the first person had not hung up . ” ​ — MICHAEL .
“ In our congregation , two pioneers began having problems .
One took to scolding the other .
Their bickering was discouraging to others . ” ​ — GARY .
“ Do not become upset with one another on the way . ”
“ Plans fail when there is no consultation . ”
With what result ?
Michael says , “ My brother genuinely forgave me . ”
“ Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another . ”
Now they get along well as they preach the good news .
That difference may seem unimportant ; yet , it can lead to serious problems . ”
As my irritation grew , I started being curt with her .
I thought , ‘ She does not show me the respect I deserve , so I am not going to show her respect . ’ ”
“ I began seeing my own personality flaws , and I was very disappointed in myself .
I realized that I had to adjust my thinking .
After praying to Jehovah about the matter , I bought the sister a small gift and wrote her a card to apologize for my bad attitude .
We hugged each other and agreed to put the matter behind us .
We have not had any more problems . ”

How did Jesus show empathy when Lazarus died ?
If you are grieving , you too can find soothing comfort from such scriptures as the following :
*
( Read 1 Thessalonians 5 : 11 . )
What do we need to remember about grief ?
Even when someone does express how he feels , it is not always easy for others to understand what he is trying to say .
At that moment , I don’t feel quite so alone in my grief . ”
“ Receiving a short encouraging message or an invitation to spend time with a fellow Christian helps me more than I can say , ” says Junia .
“ Those expressions make me feel loved and cared for . ”
“ Sometimes when sisters have come to comfort me , ” recalls Dalene , “ I have asked them if they are willing to say a prayer .
They start praying , often battling to speak at first , but every time , within a few sentences , their voice gets stronger and they say the most heartfelt prayer .
Their strong faith , their love , and their concern have been very faith - strengthening . ”

“ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of distress . ”
“ I expected my first wedding anniversary to be very traumatic , ” relates one brother , “ and it was not easy .
But a few brothers and sisters planned a small gathering of my closest friends so that I wouldn’t be on my own . ”
“ Often the help and companionship offered when there is no special anniversary can be very beneficial , ” explains Junia .
“ Those spontaneous moments are so valuable and bring much comfort . ”
They have truly made me feel Jehovah’s loving arms around me . ”
Why are Jehovah’s promises a source of great comfort ?
God promises that “ he will do away with death forever , and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces . ”
Other scriptures that many have found comforting are Psalm 20 : 1 , 2 ; 31 : 7 ; 38 : 8 , 9 , 15 ; 55 : 22 ; 121 : 1 , 2 ; Isaiah 57 : 15 ; 66 : 13 ; Philippians 4 : 13 ; and 1 Peter 5 : 7 .

“ We don’t know what to say except that we love you .
We can’t understand exactly how you feel , but Jehovah does and will keep raising you up .
We hope that our prayers will help a little . ”
“ May Jehovah sustain you at this time of such great loss . ”
“ May you find comfort in knowing that your dear one is safe in the memory of God , who will remember every detail about him and bring him back again . ”
“ Your loved one will never have to face the last enemy , death , ever again .
In the meantime , his acts of faith live on until he stands up alive and whole in the Paradise . ”
“ While words fail to capture the pain of losing a loved one , we look forward to the time when words will fail to capture the joy of having our heavenly Father return your dear one to you . ”

What plans can lead to a happy future for you ?
What could a life in the pioneer service lead to ?
YOU young ones will probably agree that before starting a journey , it is wise to plan where you will go .
Life is like a journey , and the time to plan where you want to go is when you are young .
41 : 10 .
How do you know that Jehovah wants you to plan for a happy future ?
He wants you to be happy .
What does Jehovah recommend for you ?
What plans does Jehovah recommend for you ?
Your Creator is “ the God of love , ” “ the happy God , ” who made humans “ in his image . ”
You will be happy when you imitate our loving God .
What made Jesus happy ?
Jesus Christ set the perfect example for you young ones .
Jesus also drew close to Jehovah by studying the Scriptures .
( Read Luke 10 : 21 . )
As with any career , you need time to become skilled .
At first , I couldn’t start any Bible studies , but later I moved to another territory , and within a month I started several studies .
One student began coming to the Kingdom Hall .
For example , Jacob , from North America , writes : “ When I was seven , many of my classmates were Vietnamese .
I wanted to tell them about Jehovah , so after a while I made plans to learn their language .
For the most part , I learned by comparing the English and Vietnamese editions of The Watchtower .
I also made friends in a nearby Vietnamese - language congregation .
When I was 18 , I started pioneering .
Later , I attended the Bible School for Single Brothers .
This helped me with my present pioneer assignment , where I am the only elder in a Vietnamese - language group .
Many Vietnamese people are amazed that I have learned their language .
They invite me in , and often I can study the Bible with them .
Some have progressed to baptism . ” ​ — Compare Acts 2 : 7 , 8 .
3 : 9 .
I started pioneering soon after finishing school .
I enjoy encouraging the young brothers in our congregation and seeing their spiritual progress .
After I attended the Bible School for Single Brothers , I received a new pioneer assignment .
It’s true that I have never found anyone in the territory who progressed to baptism , but others have .
11 : 6 .
There are many opportunities to serve Jehovah .
Hundreds of new Kingdom Halls are needed .
How may pioneer service lead to other opportunities ?
A brother named Kevin says : “ Ever since I was a little boy , I have wanted to serve Jehovah full - time someday .
Finally , I started pioneering when I was 19 .
I supported myself working part - time for a brother who was a builder .
I learned to install roofs , windows , and doors .
Later , I spent two years with a hurricane relief team , rebuilding Kingdom Halls and homes for the brothers .
When I heard about the construction needs in South Africa , I applied and was invited to go .
Here in Africa , I move from one Kingdom Hall project to another every few weeks .
My construction group is like a family .
The plans I made as a boy have made me happy in ways I did not foresee . ”
Bethel service is a happy way of life because everything you do there is for Jehovah .
After a year and a half , I was invited to Bethel , where I learned to operate printing presses and later to do computer programming .
At Bethel , I enjoy hearing firsthand about the progress of the disciple - making activity worldwide .
I love serving here because what we do helps people to draw close to Jehovah . ”
You can be sure that Jehovah wants you to “ get a firm hold ” on a happy future .
( Read 1 Timothy 6 : 18 , 19 . )
YOU are under attack !
What is it ?
He has studied human behavior since man was created .
How can you resist his propaganda ?
It’s something you have to find out for yourself . ”
2 : 15 .
Jesus said : “ Do not fear those who kill the body and after this are not able to do anything more . ”
What did Jehovah say in return ?
They are lying to you ! ’
Listen to Jehovah and trust in him in all that you do .

Paul said that without love , he was “ nothing . ”

No human could show greater love .
Jesus said : “ No one has love greater than this , that someone should surrender his life in behalf of his friends . ”
Yes !

“ A turning point came about 15 years after I was baptized .
During a talk at the Kingdom Hall . . . , the speaker referred to James 1 : 23 , 24 .
Those verses liken God’s Word to a mirror in which we can see ourselves the way Jehovah sees us .
I began to wonder if what I saw in myself was different from what Jehovah saw .
At first , I resisted this new idea .
I still felt that loving me was too much to expect of Jehovah .
“ A few days later , I read a scripture that changed my life .
The verse was Isaiah 1 : 18 , where Jehovah is quoted as saying : ‘ Come , now , you people , and let us set matters straight between us . . . .
Though the sins of you people should prove to be as scarlet , they will be made white just like snow . ’
I felt as if Jehovah were speaking to me , saying : ‘ Come on , Vicky , let’s set matters straight between us .
I know you , I know your sins , I know your heart ​ — and I love you . ’
“ I was unable to sleep that night .
I still doubted that Jehovah could love me , but I began thinking about Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice .
All of a sudden , it dawned on me that Jehovah had been patient with me for so long , showing me that he loved me in so many ways .
Yet , I was , in effect , saying to him : ‘ Your love is not great enough to reach me .
Your Son’s sacrifice is not enough to cover me . ’
It was as if I had been throwing the ransom back at Jehovah .
But now , at last , by meditating on this gift of the ransom , I began to feel loved by Jehovah . ”

31 One Act of Christian Kindness

We are the only Witnesses they are exposed to .

Then they may look at us as if we aren’t proud of who we are .
They may even respond unkindly because of our lack of confidence .
However , if we talk with ease and assurance about what we believe , making it a normal part of conversation , it’s more likely that they will respect us . ”
Jesus said : “ If anyone wants to come after me , let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and keep following me . ”

Because of my past , I found it difficult to feel worthy of God’s love .
Time and time again , however , Jehovah has used the congregation and the elders to confirm his love for me .
I pray that I will never let him go . ”
If you turn to doing good , will you not be restored to favor ?
But if you do not turn to doing good , sin is crouching at the door , and its craving is to dominate you ; but will you get the mastery over it ? ”
