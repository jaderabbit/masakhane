LIFE STORY
As told by Denton Hopkinson
I was only eight years old at the time .
My father did not want my mother to talk to me about what she was learning .
However , I was curious and asked questions , so she studied with me when my father was out of the house .
As a result , I too decided that I wanted to dedicate my life to Jehovah .
My mother said that I should first speak to the servant to the brethren ( now called a circuit overseer ) .
After four months , I selected a brother as my pioneer partner .
My mother pioneered with a sister in another congregation .
In 1951 , I filled out an application to attend the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead .
While there , I received my invitation to the 22nd class of Gilead .
I then traveled by train to South Lansing , New York , where the school was located .

How can you experience “ the peace of God ” ?
How can the congregation help you to reduce anxiety ?
( See opening picture . ) ( b ) What will we consider in this article ?
How , though , can you do that ?
The psalmist David begged Jehovah : “ Listen to my prayer , O God . ”
When we are anxious , why is prayer so important ?
Read Philippians 4 : 6 , 7 .
How ?
That can be your experience too .
41 : 10 .
Why is this important ?
8 - 12 .
“ Love , joy , peace . ”
How is that so ?
“ Patience , kindness , goodness . ”
“ Faith . ”
“ Mildness , self - control . ”
What did Jesus mean when he said : “ Never be anxious ” ?
What did he do ?
( See the box “ Some Practical Ways to Reduce Anxiety . ” )

How can we be sure that Jehovah rewards his servants ?
How did Jehovah bless his servants in the past ?
What rewards do we receive from Jehovah ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) How are love and faith connected ?
( b ) What questions will we consider ?
How , though , does the hope of a reward benefit us ?
Let us see .
Jesus showed that his disciples would be rewarded for their sacrifices ( See paragraph 5 )
The apostle Peter once asked Jesus : “ We have left all things and followed you ; what , then , will there be for us ? ”
In the Sermon on the Mount , Jesus said : “ Rejoice and be overjoyed , since your reward is great in the heavens , for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you . ”
Moses told the nation of Israel : “ Jehovah will surely bless you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance , but only if you strictly obey the voice of Jehovah your God and carefully observe all this commandment that I am giving you today .
For Jehovah your God will bless you just as he has promised you . ”
How did Jehovah reward Joseph ?
Not at all !
And he named the second one Ephraim , for he said , ‘ God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction . ’ ”
God’s Word explains : “ For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake , despising shame . ”
Jesus certainly found joy in being able to sanctify God’s name .
13 , 14 .
How does Jehovah feel about what we do for him ?
“ The one showing favor to the lowly is lending to Jehovah , and He will repay him for what he does . ”
And he promises to reward that kindness .
( Read 1 John 3 : 19 , 20 . )
What are some of the rewards that we enjoy now ?
How do Jehovah’s servants feel about the rewards they receive ?
For example , Bianca from Germany says : “ I cannot thank Jehovah enough for helping me with my worries and for being at my side each day .
Whenever I make personal sacrifices for him , he gives me back a hundredfold in blessings . ”
For my own encouragement , I keep a notebook with scriptures and thoughts from our publications that I can consult from time to time .
I call it ‘ My Survival Notebook . ’
Discouragement is temporary if we focus on Jehovah’s promises .
Jehovah is always there to help us , regardless of our circumstances . ”
Yet , you can likely think of ways in which Jehovah has rewarded you and those around you .

How were Paul and others set free from sin and death ?

We too live in a world filled with wickedness , which we know Jehovah has promised to destroy .
In the meantime , we cannot force people to accept the “ good news of the Kingdom . ”
2 : 3 .
What Noah could do : Instead of giving up because of what he could not do , Noah focused on what he could do .
How can we imitate Noah’s example ?
When that happened , how did David react ?
Past sins ( See paragraphs 11 - 14 )
11 , 12 . ( a ) After he sinned , what could David not do ?
What can we learn from David’s example ?

The answer to that question can determine our everlasting future .
Obviously not .

We too can choose to worship Jehovah .

Imagine that you gave a valuable gift to a friend .
What is one way we can avoid misusing our Christian freedom ?

In some cases , Jehovah disciplined or replaced those leaders .
( Read Matthew 23 : 10 . )

For what purpose ?
The July 15 , 2013 , issue of The Watchtower explained that “ the faithful and discreet slave ” is a small group of anointed brothers who make up the Governing Body .
The governing body , 1950 ’ s
So how can we answer Jesus ’ question : “ Who really is the faithful and discreet slave ? ”
How has holy spirit helped the Governing Body ?
Why has that work been so successful ?
( Read John 17 : 17 . )
What is one way to remember the Governing Body ?
Read Hebrews 13 : 7 .

32 A Bible Name on an Ancient Jar
As told by William Samuelson
Uncle Alfred and my father
We lived on a small farm in eastern South Dakota .
Farming was an important part of our family’s life , but it was not the most important part .
My parents got baptized as Jehovah’s Witnesses in 1934 .
My dad , Clarence , and later my uncle Alfred , served as company servant ( now called coordinator of the body of elders ) in our small congregation in Conde , South Dakota .
My sister , Dorothy , and I became Kingdom publishers when we were six .
Pioneering in 1952
Conventions and assemblies were an important part of our lives .
The Bible says : “ The one walking with the wise will become wise , ” and there were many wise ones in my family who supported my decision to pioneer .
Dorothy soon became a pioneer too .
When they were serving congregations nearby , they sometimes invited me to go with them in the ministry .
As a new Bethelite , with a farm truck
At WBBR with Brother Franz
Only 15 to 20 members of the Bethel family were assigned to the farm .
Most of us were young and quite inexperienced .
Brother Peterson did his work at Bethel well but never neglected the field ministry .

But the greatest one among you must be your minister .
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled , and whoever humbles himself will be exalted . ”

Loving elders help others learn to make their own decisions ( See paragraph 11 )
We need to make wise decisions .
Elders too should take time to do research .

And will it show that I am patient and kind ? ’
Why does Jehovah expect us to make our own decisions ?

( Read 2 Chronicles 34 : 1 - 3 . )
( Read 2 Chronicles 34 : 18 , 19 . )
( b ) What will we discuss in the next article ?
SONGS : 49 , 127
Asa and Jehoshaphat
Hezekiah
Josiah
Why will we consider the examples of four kings of Judah ?
What can we learn from Asa’s mistake ?
He understands our situation and loves us .
( Read 2 Chronicles 32 : 31 . )
How will he react to the praise ?
15 , 16 .
The Bible says that Necho’s words were “ from the mouth of God . ”
Let us meditate on these Bible accounts and be thankful that Jehovah has provided them for us !
3 “ What You Vow , Pay ”
How many vows have you made to Jehovah ?
What about your dedication vow or your marriage vow ?
When we believe that we have personally experienced or observed an injustice , our faith , humility , and loyalty may be tested .
“ The world is passing away and so is its desire , but the one who does the will of God remains forever . ” ​ — 1 JOHN 2 : 17 .
SONGS : 139 , 144
What will Jehovah do about wicked people and corrupt organizations ?
The Bible says : “ The world is passing away . ”
Far from it !
How do wicked people affect us now ?
What will Jehovah do ?
( Read Psalm 37 : 10 . )
There is no darkness or deep shadow where wrongdoers can conceal themselves . ”
Later in the same psalm , we read : “ The righteous will possess the earth , and they will live forever on it . ”
Who are “ the meek ” and “ the righteous ” ?
How do corrupt organizations affect us today ?
How do corrupt organizations affect us now ?
Those religious organizations will be completely destroyed .

Micah 7 : 7
Proverbs 19 : 3
Matthew 18 : 15
“ WILL the Judge of all the earth not do what is right ? ”
Because Jehovah is the greatest example of justice and righteousness .
How might a Christian’s faith be tested ?
Christians expect to experience some injustice outside the Christian congregation .
Consider the experience of Willi Diehl .
In 1946 , he attended the eighth class of Gilead School in New York , U.S.A .
After graduation , he was eventually assigned to the circuit work in Switzerland .
What examples will we consider in this article and in the next ?
In this article , we will consider Abraham’s great - grandson Joseph and his experience with his brothers .
10 , 11 . ( a ) What injustices did Joseph experience ?
Read Genesis 40 : 14 , 15 .
( Read Matthew 5 : 23 , 24 ; 18 : 15 . )
Loyalty to Jehovah and to our brothers will protect us from making such a mistake .
He never blamed Jehovah for his situation .
Most important , he did not allow the imperfections and wrong actions of others to separate him from Jehovah .
Why should we draw even closer to Jehovah if we experience injustice in the congregation ?
How can we show that we have confidence in “ the Judge of all the earth ” ?
What will we consider in the next article ?
See Willi Diehl’s life story , “ Jehovah Is My God , in Whom I Will Trust , ” in the November 1 , 1991 , issue of The Watchtower .

1 , 2 . ( a ) What injustice did Naboth and his sons experience ?
( b ) What two qualities will we consider in this article ?
IMAGINE the scene .
3 , 4 .
What kind of man was Naboth , and why did he refuse to sell his vineyard to King Ahab ?
Naboth was faithful to Jehovah at a time when most Israelites were following the bad example of King Ahab and his wife , wicked Queen Jezebel .
Read 1 Kings 21 : 1 - 3 .
He respectfully explained : “ It is unthinkable , from Jehovah’s standpoint , for me to give you the inheritance of my forefathers . ”
Ahab humbled himself !
With what result ?
Why would humility have been a protection to Naboth’s family and friends ?
( Read Deuteronomy 32 : 3 , 4 . )
( b ) In what ways will humility protect us ?
How will you respond if the elders announce a decision that you do not agree with ?
What account will we now consider , and why ?
How was Peter corrected , and what questions arise ?
Read Galatians 2 : 11 - 14 .
Would they allow themselves to be stumbled ?
How did Peter benefit from Jehovah’s forgiveness ?
In fact , he was later inspired to write two letters that became part of the Bible .

SONGS : 17 , 109
( b ) What questions arise ?
“ We could see people running , shooting .
My parents and 11 of us siblings fled for our lives with only the clothes on our backs .
The rest of us were scattered . ”
How did Jesus and many of his disciples become refugees ?
He said : “ When they persecute you in one city , flee to another . ”
“ I was 12 years old .
My feet were so swollen that I told my family to go on without me .
My father ​ — not about to abandon me to the rebel forces — ​ carried me .
They gossiped , drank , gambled , stole , and were immoral . ”
4 : 18 .
( b ) Why do they need our patient help ?
2 : 3 , 4 .
They need to see that we care about them .
( b ) How can refugees show gratitude ?
How can we help our brothers and sisters who are refugees ?
( See paragraphs 11 - 13 )
Soon , all four became pioneers .
( a ) What temptation do refugees need to resist ?
This is all you need ! ’ ” ​ — Read 1 Timothy 6 : 8 .
They need to sense Jehovah’s love and compassion among their fellow Christians .
Many of today’s refugees come from countries where our preaching work is restricted .
She said : “ The brothers there treated them like close relatives , providing food , clothes , shelter , and transportation .
Who else would welcome strangers into their home just because they worship the same God ?
Only Jehovah’s Witnesses ! ” ​ — Read John 13 : 35 .
As soon as possible after a refugee arrives , elders should follow the direction in Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will , chapter 8 , paragraph 30 .
In the meantime , they can ask discreet questions about a refugee’s congregation and ministry to discern his spiritual condition .
“ No greater joy do I have than this : that I should hear that my children go on walking in the truth . ” ​ — 3 JOHN 4 .

How can parents set a good example for their children ?
How can family heads decide which language congregation the family will attend ?
How can others help immigrant parents and their children ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What problem do many immigrant children experience ?
( b ) What questions will this article discuss ?
“ But after I started school , I began to prefer the local language .
Within a few years , the shift was complete .
I couldn’t understand the meetings , and I didn’t identify with my parents ’ culture . ”
Joshua’s experience is not uncommon .
3 , 4 . ( a ) How can parents set a good example for their children ?
( b ) What should parents not expect of their children ?
When your children see you “ seeking first the Kingdom , ” they learn to depend on Jehovah for their daily needs .
Never get so busy that you do not have time for your children .
How may your children benefit from learning your language ?
Parents , if that describes your children , can you learn at least some of the local language ?
A child who communicates best in another spoken language deserves the same concern , would you not agree ?
If that is your situation , you can still help your children to come to know and love Jehovah .
“ But when we saw her studying , praying , and doing her best to conduct family worship every week , we understood that getting to know Jehovah was very important . ”
How can parents help children who may need to study in two languages ?
( a ) Who must decide which language congregation to attend ?
That may not be the case when children do not fully understand the language .
( Read 1 Corinthians 14 : 9 , 11 . )
What can immigrant parents do ?
The answer was not what we personally found convenient .
But when we saw that they were getting little benefit from the meetings in our language , we decided to move to the local - language congregation .
Together , we regularly attended meetings and shared in the ministry .
We also invited local friends to join us for meals and excursions .
All of this helped our children to get to know the brothers and to get to know Jehovah , not only as their God but also as their Father and Friend .
We considered this to be much more important than their mastering our language . ”
Samuel adds : “ To keep ourselves spiritually strong , my wife and I also attended meetings in our language .
Life was very busy , and we were tired .
But we thank Jehovah for blessing our efforts and sacrifices .
Our three children are all serving Jehovah in the full - time ministry . ”
“ I knew the basics of my parents ’ language , but the language spoken at the meetings was over my head , ” recalls Kristina .
“ When I was 12 , I attended a convention in my school language .
For the first time , I understood that what I was hearing was the truth !
Young people , do you think that you would prefer being part of a local - language congregation ?
If so , ask yourself why .
“ When my siblings and I got into our teens , we wanted to switch to the local - language congregation , ” says Nadia , who now serves at Bethel .
“ Now we’re grateful that our parents worked hard to teach us their language and kept us in the foreign - language congregation .
It has enriched our lives and broadened our opportunities to help others get to know Jehovah . ”
( b ) How can parents get help in teaching their children the truth ?
( Read Proverbs 1 : 8 ; 31 : 10 , 27 , 28 . )
Still , parents who do not know the local language may need help to reach their children’s heart .
Both children and parents benefit from association with the congregation ( See paragraphs 18 , 19 )
( b ) What must parents continue to do ?
“ When they helped me with student talk assignments for the meeting , I always learned more .
And I enjoyed the leisure activities we shared in as a group . ”
Parents , pray to Jehovah for help , and try your best .
( Read 2 Chronicles 15 : 7 . )
Put your child’s friendship with Jehovah ahead of your own interests .

( b ) What valuable lesson did a brother in Thailand learn about his work ?
As a result , it left me almost no time for spiritual matters .
I finally realized that in order to put Kingdom interests first , I needed to change my line of work . ”
What did this brother do ?
“ After planning for about a year , ” he explained , “ I decided to become a street vendor and sell ice cream .
In the beginning , I struggled financially and got discouraged .
When I met my former workmates , they would laugh at me and ask why I thought selling ice cream was better than working with computers in an air - conditioned environment .
I prayed to Jehovah , asking him to help me to cope and to reach my goal of having more time for spiritual activities .
Before long , things began to improve .
I got better acquainted with my customers ’ tastes and became more skillful in making ice cream .
Soon , I was selling all my ice cream every day .
Actually , I was better - off financially than when I worked with computers .
It has made me happier because I do not have the stress and worry that I had with my former job .
And most important , I now feel closer to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Matthew 5 : 3 , 6 .
After his baptism , he said : “ The only regret I have is that I lost so much time before I realized that serving Jehovah brings far more happiness than pursuing the entertainment offered by this world . ”
Jesus said : “ Where your treasure is , there your heart will be also . ”
Jesus stated that “ no one can slave for two masters . ”
He added : “ You cannot slave for God and for Riches . ”

Jehovah is the God of truth .
( Read Proverbs 2 : 4 - 7 . )
How do we do that ?
How can holy spirit help us ?
Consider the experience of a brother named Peter .
To test Peter , the rabbi asked , “ So , my boy , what language was the book of Daniel written in ? ”
How did I know the answer ?
When I went home and checked the Watchtower and Awake !
magazines from the previous months , I found an article explaining that Daniel was written in Aramaic . ”

One took to scolding the other .
Their bickering was discouraging to others . ” ​ — GARY .

Michael says , “ My brother genuinely forgave me . ”
“ Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another . ”
Now they get along well as they preach the good news .
That difference may seem unimportant ; yet , it can lead to serious problems . ”
As my irritation grew , I started being curt with her .
I thought , ‘ She does not show me the respect I deserve , so I am not going to show her respect . ’ ”
“ I began seeing my own personality flaws , and I was very disappointed in myself .
I realized that I had to adjust my thinking .
After praying to Jehovah about the matter , I bought the sister a small gift and wrote her a card to apologize for my bad attitude .
We hugged each other and agreed to put the matter behind us .
We have not had any more problems . ”

“ Those spontaneous moments are so valuable and bring much comfort . ”
They have truly made me feel Jehovah’s loving arms around me . ”
Why are Jehovah’s promises a source of great comfort ?
God promises that “ he will do away with death forever , and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces . ”
Other scriptures that many have found comforting are Psalm 20 : 1 , 2 ; 31 : 7 ; 38 : 8 , 9 , 15 ; 55 : 22 ; 121 : 1 , 2 ; Isaiah 57 : 15 ; 66 : 13 ; Philippians 4 : 13 ; and 1 Peter 5 : 7 .

What plans can lead to a happy future for you ?
What could a life in the pioneer service lead to ?
YOU young ones will probably agree that before starting a journey , it is wise to plan where you will go .
Life is like a journey , and the time to plan where you want to go is when you are young .
How do you know that Jehovah wants you to plan for a happy future ?
He wants you to be happy .
What does Jehovah recommend for you ?
What plans does Jehovah recommend for you ?
Your Creator is “ the God of love , ” “ the happy God , ” who made humans “ in his image . ”

Jesus Christ set the perfect example for you young ones .
Jesus also drew close to Jehovah by studying the Scriptures .
( Read Luke 10 : 21 . )
“ Plans fail when there is no consultation , but there is accomplishment through many advisers . ”
As with any career , you need time to become skilled .
At first , I couldn’t start any Bible studies , but later I moved to another territory , and within a month I started several studies .
One student began coming to the Kingdom Hall .
For example , Jacob , from North America , writes : “ When I was seven , many of my classmates were Vietnamese .
I wanted to tell them about Jehovah , so after a while I made plans to learn their language .
For the most part , I learned by comparing the English and Vietnamese editions of The Watchtower .
I also made friends in a nearby Vietnamese - language congregation .
When I was 18 , I started pioneering .
Later , I attended the Bible School for Single Brothers .
This helped me with my present pioneer assignment , where I am the only elder in a Vietnamese - language group .
Many Vietnamese people are amazed that I have learned their language .
They invite me in , and often I can study the Bible with them .
Some have progressed to baptism . ” ​ — Compare Acts 2 : 7 , 8 .
I started pioneering soon after finishing school .
I enjoy encouraging the young brothers in our congregation and seeing their spiritual progress .
After I attended the Bible School for Single Brothers , I received a new pioneer assignment .
It’s true that I have never found anyone in the territory who progressed to baptism , but others have .
There are many opportunities to serve Jehovah .
Hundreds of new Kingdom Halls are needed .
How may pioneer service lead to other opportunities ?
A brother named Kevin says : “ Ever since I was a little boy , I have wanted to serve Jehovah full - time someday .
Finally , I started pioneering when I was 19 .
I supported myself working part - time for a brother who was a builder .
I learned to install roofs , windows , and doors .
Later , I spent two years with a hurricane relief team , rebuilding Kingdom Halls and homes for the brothers .
When I heard about the construction needs in South Africa , I applied and was invited to go .
Here in Africa , I move from one Kingdom Hall project to another every few weeks .
My construction group is like a family .
We live together , study the Bible together , and work together .
I also enjoy preaching with the local brothers each week .
The plans I made as a boy have made me happy in ways I did not foresee . ”
Bethel service is a happy way of life because everything you do there is for Jehovah .
After a year and a half , I was invited to Bethel , where I learned to operate printing presses and later to do computer programming .
At Bethel , I enjoy hearing firsthand about the progress of the disciple - making activity worldwide .
I love serving here because what we do helps people to draw close to Jehovah . ”
You can be sure that Jehovah wants you to “ get a firm hold ” on a happy future .
( Read 1 Timothy 6 : 18 , 19 . )

Paul said that without love , he was “ nothing . ”
“ God is love . ”
The love is in this respect , not that we have loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins . ”
No human could show greater love .
Jesus said : “ No one has love greater than this , that someone should surrender his life in behalf of his friends . ”
Let us consider how we can do so .
John wrote : “ Little children , we should love , not in word or with the tongue , but in deed and truth . ”
3 : 13 .
How can we do this ?
Let us consider three ways .
It hurt me deeply .
But then I asked myself , ‘ How can I imitate Jesus in dealing with this person ? ’
After reflecting on what Jesus would have done , I decided to let the matter go and not make an issue of it .
Later , I learned that my coworker had been coping with a serious health problem and was under a lot of stress .
I concluded that she probably did not really mean what she wrote .
Reflecting on Jesus ’ example of showing love even when provoked helped me to show similar love to my coworker . ”
By leaving heaven , “ he emptied himself ” in our behalf , even “ to the point of death . ”
Consider two examples :
How do we benefit from showing love ?
PEACE : “ Putting up with one another in love ” allows us to enjoy “ the uniting bond of peace . ”
Would you not agree that such a peaceful spirit is truly unique in today’s divided world ?

( Read Psalm 37 : 25 ; Hebrews 13 : 5 . )
A brother who has two children wrote : “ Many parents expend much effort and resources helping their children reach goals in such areas as sports , recreation , and education .
It makes so much more sense to expend effort and resources in helping our children reach goals that will help them to maintain a good standing with Jehovah .
It has been a great source of satisfaction not only to see our children reach spiritual goals but to share the journey with them . ”
Give examples of courage in the Christian congregation .

“ A turning point came about 15 years after I was baptized .
During a talk at the Kingdom Hall . . . , the speaker referred to James 1 : 23 , 24 .
Those verses liken God’s Word to a mirror in which we can see ourselves the way Jehovah sees us .
I began to wonder if what I saw in myself was different from what Jehovah saw .
At first , I resisted this new idea .
I still felt that loving me was too much to expect of Jehovah .
“ A few days later , I read a scripture that changed my life .
The verse was Isaiah 1 : 18 , where Jehovah is quoted as saying : ‘ Come , now , you people , and let us set matters straight between us . . . .
Though the sins of you people should prove to be as scarlet , they will be made white just like snow . ’
I felt as if Jehovah were speaking to me , saying : ‘ Come on , Vicky , let’s set matters straight between us .
I know you , I know your sins , I know your heart ​ — and I love you . ’
“ I was unable to sleep that night .
I still doubted that Jehovah could love me , but I began thinking about Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice .
All of a sudden , it dawned on me that Jehovah had been patient with me for so long , showing me that he loved me in so many ways .
Yet , I was , in effect , saying to him : ‘ Your love is not great enough to reach me .
Your Son’s sacrifice is not enough to cover me . ’
It was as if I had been throwing the ransom back at Jehovah .
But now , at last , by meditating on this gift of the ransom , I began to feel loved by Jehovah . ”

Anointed ones who are alive during the great tribulation will be “ caught away in clouds . ”

Although the immediate point is not in itself about the Bible , often others are curious about what I do when teaching the Bible .
Sometimes they ask questions about it .
The more I use this approach , the easier it gets .
And afterward , I always feel great ! ”
We are the only Witnesses they are exposed to .
So the way we act can determine how they will respond .
What if we are shy or timid or have a hard time speaking up about our faith , or what if we cringe when we do speak up ?
Then they may look at us as if we aren’t proud of who we are .
They may even respond unkindly because of our lack of confidence .
However , if we talk with ease and assurance about what we believe , making it a normal part of conversation , it’s more likely that they will respect us . ”
Jesus said : “ If anyone wants to come after me , let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and keep following me . ”
