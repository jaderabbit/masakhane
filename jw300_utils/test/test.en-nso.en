“ The word of God is alive and exerts power . ” ​ — HEB .
Those verses liken God’s Word to a mirror in which we can see ourselves the way Jehovah sees us .
I began to wonder if what I saw in myself was different from what Jehovah saw .

I still doubted that Jehovah could love me , but I began thinking about Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice .
All of a sudden , it dawned on me that Jehovah had been patient with me for so long , showing me that he loved me in so many ways .
It was as if I had been throwing the ransom back at Jehovah .

As told by Thomas McLain
Let me explain what led to that conversation .
I WAS born in Wichita , Kansas , U.S.A . , on December 10 , 1936 , the oldest of four children .
Then a soldier walked by , and the doctor yelled , “ Do something about this yellow coward ! ”
The soldier could see that the man was drunk , so he told him , “ Go home and sober up ! ”
They both left .
He owned two barbershops in Wichita , and the doctor was one of his clients !
With my parents , going to a convention in Wichita in the 1940 ’ s
With Jehovah’s blessing and their zealous work , a congregation was started .
Finally , an older sister started attending .
We were assigned to special pioneer in Walnut Ridge , Arkansas .
Then in 1962 , we were thrilled to receive an invitation to the 37th class of Gilead .
Soon after , our first daughter , Kimberly , was born , and 17 months later , we had Stephany .
We would also go camping with them and would have very enjoyable conversations around the campfire .
We arranged to have some who were in the full - time ministry stay in our home .
Our daughters really wanted to do that .
They were shocked and started to cry and said that they wanted to study .
With the help and direction of God’s organization , we did our best to raise them to love Jehovah .
On a later trip , Kimberly met one of his workmates , Brian Llewellyn .
So they did stay free until they were at least 23 .
At the same time , Brian and Kimberly were invited to work at London Bethel and later were transferred to Malawi Bethel .
The day after we left for the Watchtower Educational Center in Patterson , Linda called to tell us that Mother had died .
Next , we taught the course in Zimbabwe and then in Zambia .
In 2006 , Brian and Kimberly moved next door to us to raise their two daughters , Mackenzie and Elizabeth .
Paul and Stephany are still in Malawi , where Paul serves on the Branch Committee .

That is why I regularly set aside time to study the Bible and other publications in my mother tongue . ”
“ It annoyed him to go out in the ministry in another language , whereas before he loved preaching in his native language , French , ” says Muriel .

Make sure that the truth reaches the hearts of your children ( See paragraphs 14 , 15 )

As told by Denton Hopkinson
I was only eight years old at the time .
My father did not want my mother to talk to me about what she was learning .
However , I was curious and asked questions , so she studied with me when my father was out of the house .
As a result , I too decided that I wanted to dedicate my life to Jehovah .
My mother said that I should first speak to the servant to the brethren ( now called a circuit overseer ) .
After four months , I selected a brother as my pioneer partner .
My mother pioneered with a sister in another congregation .
In 1951 , I filled out an application to attend the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead .
While there , I received my invitation to the 22nd class of Gilead .
I then traveled by train to South Lansing , New York , where the school was located .

( Read Matthew 6 : 33 . )
Jesus showed that his disciples would be rewarded for their sacrifices ( See paragraph 5 )
The apostle Peter once asked Jesus : “ We have left all things and followed you ; what , then , will there be for us ? ”
In the Sermon on the Mount , Jesus said : “ Rejoice and be overjoyed , since your reward is great in the heavens , for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you . ”
Moses told the nation of Israel : “ Jehovah will surely bless you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance , but only if you strictly obey the voice of Jehovah your God and carefully observe all this commandment that I am giving you today .
For Jehovah your God will bless you just as he has promised you . ”
How did Jehovah reward Joseph ?
And he named the second one Ephraim , for he said , ‘ God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction . ’ ”
God’s Word explains : “ For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake , despising shame . ”
Jesus certainly found joy in being able to sanctify God’s name .
How does Jehovah feel about what we do for him ?
“ The one showing favor to the lowly is lending to Jehovah , and He will repay him for what he does . ”
And he promises to reward that kindness .
( Read 1 John 3 : 19 , 20 . )
What are some of the rewards that we enjoy now ?
How do Jehovah’s servants feel about the rewards they receive ?
For example , Bianca from Germany says : “ I cannot thank Jehovah enough for helping me with my worries and for being at my side each day .
Whenever I make personal sacrifices for him , he gives me back a hundredfold in blessings . ”
For my own encouragement , I keep a notebook with scriptures and thoughts from our publications that I can consult from time to time .
I call it ‘ My Survival Notebook . ’
Discouragement is temporary if we focus on Jehovah’s promises .
Jehovah is always there to help us , regardless of our circumstances . ”

Yet , Jehovah viewed those kings as having a complete heart .
Will God view us as having a complete heart , despite mistakes we make ?
32 A Bible Name on an Ancient Jar
As told by William Samuelson
Uncle Alfred and my father
We lived on a small farm in eastern South Dakota .
Farming was an important part of our family’s life , but it was not the most important part .
My parents got baptized as Jehovah’s Witnesses in 1934 .
My dad , Clarence , and later my uncle Alfred , served as company servant ( now called coordinator of the body of elders ) in our small congregation in Conde , South Dakota .
My sister , Dorothy , and I became Kingdom publishers when we were six .
Pioneering in 1952
Conventions and assemblies were an important part of our lives .
The Bible says : “ The one walking with the wise will become wise , ” and there were many wise ones in my family who supported my decision to pioneer .
Dorothy soon became a pioneer too .
When they were serving congregations nearby , they sometimes invited me to go with them in the ministry .
As a new Bethelite , with a farm truck
At WBBR with Brother Franz
Only 15 to 20 members of the Bethel family were assigned to the farm .
Most of us were young and quite inexperienced .
Brother Peterson did his work at Bethel well but never neglected the field ministry .

( Read 2 Corinthians 1 : 24 . )
Loving elders help others learn to make their own decisions ( See paragraph 11 )
We need to make wise decisions .
Elders too should take time to do research .

And will it show that I am patient and kind ? ’
Why does Jehovah expect us to make our own decisions ?

3 “ What You Vow , Pay ”
How many vows have you made to Jehovah ?
What about your dedication vow or your marriage vow ?
When we believe that we have personally experienced or observed an injustice , our faith , humility , and loyalty may be tested .
“ The world is passing away and so is its desire , but the one who does the will of God remains forever . ” ​ — 1 JOHN 2 : 17 .
SONGS : 139 , 144
What will Jehovah do about wicked people and corrupt organizations ?
The Bible says : “ The world is passing away . ”
How do wicked people affect us now ?
What will Jehovah do ?
( Read Psalm 37 : 10 . )
There is no darkness or deep shadow where wrongdoers can conceal themselves . ”
Later in the same psalm , we read : “ The righteous will possess the earth , and they will live forever on it . ”
Who are “ the meek ” and “ the righteous ” ?
How do corrupt organizations affect us today ?
How do corrupt organizations affect us now ?
Those religious organizations will be completely destroyed .

Proverbs 19 : 3
Matthew 18 : 15
“ WILL the Judge of all the earth not do what is right ? ”
Because Jehovah is the greatest example of justice and righteousness .
How might a Christian’s faith be tested ?
Christians expect to experience some injustice outside the Christian congregation .
Consider the experience of Willi Diehl .
In 1946 , he attended the eighth class of Gilead School in New York , U.S.A .
After graduation , he was eventually assigned to the circuit work in Switzerland .
What examples will we consider in this article and in the next ?
In this article , we will consider Abraham’s great - grandson Joseph and his experience with his brothers .
10 , 11 . ( a ) What injustices did Joseph experience ?
Read Genesis 40 : 14 , 15 .
( Read Matthew 5 : 23 , 24 ; 18 : 15 . )
Loyalty to Jehovah and to our brothers will protect us from making such a mistake .
He never blamed Jehovah for his situation .
Most important , he did not allow the imperfections and wrong actions of others to separate him from Jehovah .
Why should we draw even closer to Jehovah if we experience injustice in the congregation ?
How can we show that we have confidence in “ the Judge of all the earth ” ?
See Willi Diehl’s life story , “ Jehovah Is My God , in Whom I Will Trust , ” in the November 1 , 1991 , issue of The Watchtower .

What kind of man was Naboth , and why did he refuse to sell his vineyard to King Ahab ?
Naboth was faithful to Jehovah at a time when most Israelites were following the bad example of King Ahab and his wife , wicked Queen Jezebel .
Read 1 Kings 21 : 1 - 3 .
He respectfully explained : “ It is unthinkable , from Jehovah’s standpoint , for me to give you the inheritance of my forefathers . ”
Ahab humbled himself !
Why would humility have been a protection to Naboth’s family and friends ?
( Read Deuteronomy 32 : 3 , 4 . )
( b ) In what ways will humility protect us ?
How will you respond if the elders announce a decision that you do not agree with ?
What account will we now consider , and why ?
How was Peter corrected , and what questions arise ?
Read Galatians 2 : 11 - 14 .

In fact , he was later inspired to write two letters that became part of the Bible .
3 Helping “ Foreign Residents ” to “ Serve Jehovah With Rejoicing ”
The second article considers how applying Bible principles will help immigrant parents to make decisions that will benefit their children .
SONGS : 17 , 109
“ We could see people running , shooting .
My parents and 11 of us siblings fled for our lives with only the clothes on our backs .
The rest of us were scattered . ”
How did Jesus and many of his disciples become refugees ?
He said : “ When they persecute you in one city , flee to another . ”
“ I was 12 years old .
My feet were so swollen that I told my family to go on without me .
My father ​ — not about to abandon me to the rebel forces — ​ carried me .
They gossiped , drank , gambled , stole , and were immoral . ”
( Read 1 John 3 : 17 , 18 . )
( b ) Why do they need our patient help ?
They need to see that we care about them .
( b ) How can refugees show gratitude ?
How can we help our brothers and sisters who are refugees ?
( See paragraphs 11 - 13 )
Soon , all four became pioneers .
( a ) What temptation do refugees need to resist ?
This is all you need ! ’ ” ​ — Read 1 Timothy 6 : 8 .
They need to sense Jehovah’s love and compassion among their fellow Christians .
Many of today’s refugees come from countries where our preaching work is restricted .
She said : “ The brothers there treated them like close relatives , providing food , clothes , shelter , and transportation .
Who else would welcome strangers into their home just because they worship the same God ?
Only Jehovah’s Witnesses ! ” ​ — Read John 13 : 35 .
As soon as possible after a refugee arrives , elders should follow the direction in Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will , chapter 8 , paragraph 30 .
In the meantime , they can ask discreet questions about a refugee’s congregation and ministry to discern his spiritual condition .
“ No greater joy do I have than this : that I should hear that my children go on walking in the truth . ” ​ — 3 JOHN 4 .
SONGS : 134 , 133

How can family heads decide which language congregation the family will attend ?
How can others help immigrant parents and their children ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What problem do many immigrant children experience ?
( b ) What questions will this article discuss ?
“ But after I started school , I began to prefer the local language .
Within a few years , the shift was complete .
I couldn’t understand the meetings , and I didn’t identify with my parents ’ culture . ”
Joshua’s experience is not uncommon .
And how can others help ?
3 , 4 . ( a ) How can parents set a good example for their children ?
( b ) What should parents not expect of their children ?
When your children see you “ seeking first the Kingdom , ” they learn to depend on Jehovah for their daily needs .
Never get so busy that you do not have time for your children .
How may your children benefit from learning your language ?
Parents , if that describes your children , can you learn at least some of the local language ?
A child who communicates best in another spoken language deserves the same concern , would you not agree ?
If that is your situation , you can still help your children to come to know and love Jehovah .
“ But when we saw her studying , praying , and doing her best to conduct family worship every week , we understood that getting to know Jehovah was very important . ”
How can parents help children who may need to study in two languages ?
( a ) Who must decide which language congregation to attend ?
That may not be the case when children do not fully understand the language .
( Read 1 Corinthians 14 : 9 , 11 . )
What can immigrant parents do ?
The answer was not what we personally found convenient .
But when we saw that they were getting little benefit from the meetings in our language , we decided to move to the local - language congregation .
Together , we regularly attended meetings and shared in the ministry .
We also invited local friends to join us for meals and excursions .
All of this helped our children to get to know the brothers and to get to know Jehovah , not only as their God but also as their Father and Friend .
We considered this to be much more important than their mastering our language . ”
Samuel adds : “ To keep ourselves spiritually strong , my wife and I also attended meetings in our language .
Life was very busy , and we were tired .
But we thank Jehovah for blessing our efforts and sacrifices .
Our three children are all serving Jehovah in the full - time ministry . ”
“ I knew the basics of my parents ’ language , but the language spoken at the meetings was over my head , ” recalls Kristina .
“ When I was 12 , I attended a convention in my school language .
For the first time , I understood that what I was hearing was the truth !
Young people , do you think that you would prefer being part of a local - language congregation ?
If so , ask yourself why .
“ When my siblings and I got into our teens , we wanted to switch to the local - language congregation , ” says Nadia , who now serves at Bethel .
“ Now we’re grateful that our parents worked hard to teach us their language and kept us in the foreign - language congregation .
It has enriched our lives and broadened our opportunities to help others get to know Jehovah . ”
( b ) How can parents get help in teaching their children the truth ?
( Read Proverbs 1 : 8 ; 31 : 10 , 27 , 28 . )
Still , parents who do not know the local language may need help to reach their children’s heart .
Both children and parents benefit from association with the congregation ( See paragraphs 18 , 19 )
( b ) What must parents continue to do ?
“ When they helped me with student talk assignments for the meeting , I always learned more .
And I enjoyed the leisure activities we shared in as a group . ”
Parents , pray to Jehovah for help , and try your best .
( Read 2 Chronicles 15 : 7 . )
Put your child’s friendship with Jehovah ahead of your own interests .

How can we keep our love for Jehovah strong ?
How can we deepen our love for Bible truth ?
Why is it important to have affection for our brothers ?
What may have caused the love of some Christians to grow cold ?
People today have less and less love for God .
Show love for Jehovah ( See paragraph 10 )
( Read Psalm 119 : 97 - 100 . )
Show love for Bible truth ( See paragraph 14 )
On his last night on earth , Jesus said to his disciples : “ I am giving you a new commandment , that you love one another ; just as I have loved you , you also love one another .
By this all will know that you are my disciples ​ — if you have love among yourselves . ” ​ — John 13 : 34 , 35 .
The apostle John wrote : “ The one who does not love his brother , whom he has seen , cannot love God , whom he has not seen . ”
Show love for the brothers and sisters ( See paragraph 17 )

( b ) What valuable lesson did a brother in Thailand learn about his work ?
As a result , it left me almost no time for spiritual matters .
I finally realized that in order to put Kingdom interests first , I needed to change my line of work . ”
What did this brother do ?
“ After planning for about a year , ” he explained , “ I decided to become a street vendor and sell ice cream .
In the beginning , I struggled financially and got discouraged .
When I met my former workmates , they would laugh at me and ask why I thought selling ice cream was better than working with computers in an air - conditioned environment .
I prayed to Jehovah , asking him to help me to cope and to reach my goal of having more time for spiritual activities .
Before long , things began to improve .
I got better acquainted with my customers ’ tastes and became more skillful in making ice cream .
Soon , I was selling all my ice cream every day .
Actually , I was better - off financially than when I worked with computers .
It has made me happier because I do not have the stress and worry that I had with my former job .
And most important , I now feel closer to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Matthew 5 : 3 , 6 .
After his baptism , he said : “ The only regret I have is that I lost so much time before I realized that serving Jehovah brings far more happiness than pursuing the entertainment offered by this world . ”
Jesus stated that “ no one can slave for two masters . ”
He added : “ You cannot slave for God and for Riches . ”
( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 14 . )
( See paragraph 18 )
See the article “ Is Your Recreation Beneficial ? ”
We also shared regularly in the field ministry . ”
We were so sad to leave our Bible students behind . ”
But then , a month later , they received thrilling news .

What a joy to be able to stay in our assignment ! ”
They trusted in the promise found at Psalm 37 : 5 : “ Commit your way to Jehovah ; rely on him , and he will act in your behalf . ”
Today we do , and we lack nothing of real importance . ”

9 Set Your Heart on Spiritual Treasures
SONGS : 33 , 41
Why can we expect that marriage and family life will involve some trials ?
We can be sure that he wants the best for us , as he did for his servants in the past . ​ — Read Jeremiah 29 : 11 , 12 .

( Read Proverbs 2 : 4 - 7 . )
How can holy spirit help us ?
Consider the experience of a brother named Peter .
To test Peter , the rabbi asked , “ So , my boy , what language was the book of Daniel written in ? ”

magazines from the previous months , I found an article explaining that Daniel was written in Aramaic . ”

One took to scolding the other .
Their bickering was discouraging to others . ” ​ — GARY .

Michael says , “ My brother genuinely forgave me . ”
“ Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another . ”
Now they get along well as they preach the good news .
That difference may seem unimportant ; yet , it can lead to serious problems . ”
As my irritation grew , I started being curt with her .
I thought , ‘ She does not show me the respect I deserve , so I am not going to show her respect . ’ ”
“ I began seeing my own personality flaws , and I was very disappointed in myself .
I realized that I had to adjust my thinking .
After praying to Jehovah about the matter , I bought the sister a small gift and wrote her a card to apologize for my bad attitude .
We hugged each other and agreed to put the matter behind us .
We have not had any more problems . ”

If you are grieving , you too can find soothing comfort from such scriptures as the following :
( Read 1 Thessalonians 5 : 11 . )
What do we need to remember about grief ?
Even when someone does express how he feels , it is not always easy for others to understand what he is trying to say .
At that moment , I don’t feel quite so alone in my grief . ”

Their strong faith , their love , and their concern have been very faith - strengthening . ”

“ Often the help and companionship offered when there is no special anniversary can be very beneficial , ” explains Junia .
“ Those spontaneous moments are so valuable and bring much comfort . ”
They have truly made me feel Jehovah’s loving arms around me . ”
Why are Jehovah’s promises a source of great comfort ?
God promises that “ he will do away with death forever , and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces . ”
Other scriptures that many have found comforting are Psalm 20 : 1 , 2 ; 31 : 7 ; 38 : 8 , 9 , 15 ; 55 : 22 ; 121 : 1 , 2 ; Isaiah 57 : 15 ; 66 : 13 ; Philippians 4 : 13 ; and 1 Peter 5 : 7 .

We hope that our prayers will help a little . ”

“ May you find comfort in knowing that your dear one is safe in the memory of God , who will remember every detail about him and bring him back again . ”

He brings peace to your territory . ”
( See paragraphs 15 - 17 )

What plans can lead to a happy future for you ?
What could a life in the pioneer service lead to ?
YOU young ones will probably agree that before starting a journey , it is wise to plan where you will go .
Life is like a journey , and the time to plan where you want to go is when you are young .
How do you know that Jehovah wants you to plan for a happy future ?
He wants you to be happy .
What does Jehovah recommend for you ?
What plans does Jehovah recommend for you ?
Your Creator is “ the God of love , ” “ the happy God , ” who made humans “ in his image . ”
You will be happy when you imitate our loving God .
What made Jesus happy ?
Jesus Christ set the perfect example for you young ones .
Jesus also drew close to Jehovah by studying the Scriptures .
“ Plans fail when there is no consultation , but there is accomplishment through many advisers . ”
As with any career , you need time to become skilled .
At first , I couldn’t start any Bible studies , but later I moved to another territory , and within a month I started several studies .
One student began coming to the Kingdom Hall .
For example , Jacob , from North America , writes : “ When I was seven , many of my classmates were Vietnamese .
I wanted to tell them about Jehovah , so after a while I made plans to learn their language .
For the most part , I learned by comparing the English and Vietnamese editions of The Watchtower .
I also made friends in a nearby Vietnamese - language congregation .
When I was 18 , I started pioneering .
Later , I attended the Bible School for Single Brothers .
This helped me with my present pioneer assignment , where I am the only elder in a Vietnamese - language group .
Many Vietnamese people are amazed that I have learned their language .
They invite me in , and often I can study the Bible with them .
Some have progressed to baptism . ” ​ — Compare Acts 2 : 7 , 8 .
I started pioneering soon after finishing school .
I enjoy encouraging the young brothers in our congregation and seeing their spiritual progress .
After I attended the Bible School for Single Brothers , I received a new pioneer assignment .
It’s true that I have never found anyone in the territory who progressed to baptism , but others have .
There are many opportunities to serve Jehovah .
Hundreds of new Kingdom Halls are needed .
How may pioneer service lead to other opportunities ?
A brother named Kevin says : “ Ever since I was a little boy , I have wanted to serve Jehovah full - time someday .
Finally , I started pioneering when I was 19 .
I supported myself working part - time for a brother who was a builder .
I learned to install roofs , windows , and doors .
Later , I spent two years with a hurricane relief team , rebuilding Kingdom Halls and homes for the brothers .
When I heard about the construction needs in South Africa , I applied and was invited to go .
Here in Africa , I move from one Kingdom Hall project to another every few weeks .
My construction group is like a family .
We live together , study the Bible together , and work together .
I also enjoy preaching with the local brothers each week .
The plans I made as a boy have made me happy in ways I did not foresee . ”
Bethel service is a happy way of life because everything you do there is for Jehovah .
After a year and a half , I was invited to Bethel , where I learned to operate printing presses and later to do computer programming .
At Bethel , I enjoy hearing firsthand about the progress of the disciple - making activity worldwide .
I love serving here because what we do helps people to draw close to Jehovah . ”
You can be sure that Jehovah wants you to “ get a firm hold ” on a happy future .
( Read 1 Timothy 6 : 18 , 19 . )
Then plan to do what is pleasing to him .
YOU are under attack !
He has studied human behavior since man was created .
How can you resist his propaganda ?
It’s something you have to find out for yourself . ”
Jesus said : “ Do not fear those who kill the body and after this are not able to do anything more . ”
What did Jehovah say in return ?
They are lying to you ! ’
Listen to Jehovah and trust in him in all that you do .
3 Are You Willing to Wait Patiently ?
The second article highlights how Jehovah can do the unexpected by accomplishing things we could never imagine .
27 Love ​ — A Precious Quality
SONGS : 114 , 79
Like the farmer , we need to wait patiently .
What can we learn from the example of the prophet Micah ?
( Read Micah 7 : 1 - 3 . )
If we have faith like that of Micah , we will be willing to wait for Jehovah .
So we “ endure fully with patience and joy . ”
Abraham had to wait many years before his grandsons Esau and Jacob were born ( See paragraphs 9 , 10 )
Consider the example of Abraham and Sarah .
Why did Abraham need to show patience ?
( Read Hebrews 11 : 8 - 12 . )
But just imagine Abraham’s joy when he is resurrected back to a paradise earth .
It was his faith in Jehovah .
Although you meant to harm me , God intended it to turn out well and to preserve many people alive , as he is doing today . ”
( b ) What helped David to wait patiently ?
Why was David willing to wait patiently ?
I will sing to Jehovah , for he has richly rewarded me . ”

What lessons do we learn from what happened to the apostle Paul in Philippi ?
( Read Acts 16 : 8 - 10 . )

Both he and Silas started “ praying and praising God with song . ”
4 , 5 . ( a ) How could our situation be similar to that of Paul ?
( b ) How did Paul’s situation change unexpectedly ?
How quickly everything changed !
What will we now discuss and review together ?
( Read 1 Peter 5 : 6 , 7 . )
Sometimes he surprises us by doing the unexpected .
Jehovah sent an angel to destroy 185,000 of Sennacherib’s soldiers in one night .
( a ) What lesson do we learn from what happened to Joseph ?
No doubt Jehovah’s actions exceeded all of Joseph’s expectations .
Think , too , about Joseph’s great - grandmother Sarah .
What confidence can we have in Jehovah ?
( Read Isaiah 43 : 10 - 13 . )
We know that Jehovah cares for us and wants us to succeed .
SONGS : 121 , 142
What makes our worldwide brotherhood unique ?
How can we strip off and keep off the old personality ?
By 1939 there were 6,000 of them in the [ concentration camps ] . ”
And you people have cleaned the stadium so nicely .
But most of all , you are truly multiracial . ”
What makes our brotherhood unique ?
Sexual immorality .
But the more I had sexual relations , the more insecure I felt . ”
This way of life continued until Sakura was 23 years old .
Uncleanness .
It got so bad that I could not wait for the woman I was living with to leave the house so that I could watch pornographic videos . ”
What helped Stephen to put away anger and abusive speech ?
He says : “ Our family life improved dramatically .
Today , Stephen serves as a ministerial servant , and his wife has been a regular pioneer for several years .
But Hans was not always meek .
Bible texts that encouraged me were Isaiah 55 : 7 , which says : ‘ Let the wicked man leave his way , ’ and 1 Corinthians 6 : 11 , which says about those who had abandoned sinful ways : ‘ And yet that is what some of you were . ’
For many years , Jehovah patiently helped me by means of his holy spirit to put on the new personality . ”
We also benefit from God’s Word and his holy spirit when we prepare for and attend congregation meetings .
See chapter 25 in the book Questions Young People Ask ​ — Answers That Work , Volume 1 .
SONGS : 126 , 28

( See opening picture . ) ( b ) What have been the results ?

( See paragraph 10 )
When we showed them scriptures from their Portuguese Bible , such as Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 or Psalm 37 : 10 , 11 , 29 , they paid attention and sometimes even shed tears . ”
We are so thankful to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Acts 10 : 34 , 35 .
Read Proverbs 22 : 4 .
What example did Jesus set in showing mildness and patience ?
Jesus was “ mild - tempered . ”
How can we show mildness and patience ?
Just as Jehovah freely forgave you , you must also do the same . ”
Why are mildness and patience important ?
Then he added : “ If you continue showing favoritism , you are committing sin . ”
Why is it important that we clothe ourselves with love ?
Love is also “ patient and kind ” and “ does not get puffed up . ”
LOVE
PATIENCE
KINDNESS
GOODNESS
FAITH
MILDNESS
SELF - CONTROL
Paul said that without love , he was “ nothing . ”
The love is in this respect , not that we have loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins . ”
No human could show greater love .
Jesus said : “ No one has love greater than this , that someone should surrender his life in behalf of his friends . ”
Let us consider how we can do so .
John wrote : “ Little children , we should love , not in word or with the tongue , but in deed and truth . ”
It hurt me deeply .
But then I asked myself , ‘ How can I imitate Jesus in dealing with this person ? ’
After reflecting on what Jesus would have done , I decided to let the matter go and not make an issue of it .
Later , I learned that my coworker had been coping with a serious health problem and was under a lot of stress .
I concluded that she probably did not really mean what she wrote .
Reflecting on Jesus ’ example of showing love even when provoked helped me to show similar love to my coworker . ”
By leaving heaven , “ he emptied himself ” in our behalf , even “ to the point of death . ”
How do we benefit from showing love ?
PEACE : “ Putting up with one another in love ” allows us to enjoy “ the uniting bond of peace . ”
Would you not agree that such a peaceful spirit is truly unique in today’s divided world ?

We read : “ Jehovah the God of their forefathers kept warning them by means of his messengers , warning them again and again , because he felt compassion for his people and for his dwelling place . ”

I could barely talk to people at the Kingdom Hall , much less knock on the doors of complete strangers . ”
With the help of her parents and others in the congregation , this young Christian achieved her goal of becoming a regular pioneer .
Christian parents also need courage .
How can Psalm 37 : 25 and Hebrews 13 : 5 help parents ?
( Read Psalm 37 : 25 ; Hebrews 13 : 5 . )
A brother who has two children wrote : “ Many parents expend much effort and resources helping their children reach goals in such areas as sports , recreation , and education .
It makes so much more sense to expend effort and resources in helping our children reach goals that will help them to maintain a good standing with Jehovah .
It has been a great source of satisfaction not only to see our children reach spiritual goals but to share the journey with them . ”

“ A turning point came about 15 years after I was baptized .
During a talk at the Kingdom Hall . . . , the speaker referred to James 1 : 23 , 24 .
“ A few days later , I read a scripture that changed my life .
The verse was Isaiah 1 : 18 , where Jehovah is quoted as saying : ‘ Come , now , you people , and let us set matters straight between us . . . .
Though the sins of you people should prove to be as scarlet , they will be made white just like snow . ’

Yet , I was , in effect , saying to him : ‘ Your love is not great enough to reach me .

Time and time again , however , Jehovah has used the congregation and the elders to confirm his love for me .
I pray that I will never let him go . ”

They wanted me to make the military my career .
This time , however , they invited me to come to a Congregation Book Study , a small meeting for Bible study and discussion that was held in their home .
