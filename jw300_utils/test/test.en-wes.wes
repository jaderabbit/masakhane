Any thing weh man yi heart talk say make ih give - am , e go helep say make this work go before .
For give thing weh e komot for ya heart , go for www.jw.org .
If we no show other Bible , know say all Scripture them komot na for , New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures .
Bebe and yi papa be over like their self .
And the person weh ih be talk that talk for yi be be na their tight family friend , but for Bebe , instead for the talk for comfort yi , e be instead hot yi .
Bebe be di ever talk for yi self say : “ E no be be na fine thing for yi papa for die . ”
Weiti weh Bebe be write - am about the story , be di show fine say after plenty year them , yi papa yi die be di still hot yi .
Bebe be kam see - am say , e fit take some man long time before yi heart cool , especially if the person be over be tight with the man weh ih die .
Bible di show we fine say die na we last enemy time weh e call die say : ‘ The last enemy . ’
( 1 Corinthians 15 : 26 ) Die di just kam , e spoil all thing for we life and nothing no fit stop yi . Plenty time , e di kam time weh we no prepare , and e just take the people weh we like them plenty .
Die na thing weh e di touch all man .
Na why that e no di suprise we if some man di cry yi person weh ih don die , even after they don bury - am .
Some time you too fit don ask ya self say : ‘ Na which time get for pas before person yi heart cool ?
Na how A fit comfort other people weh their person don die ?
We go ever see we person again ? ’
You don ever suffer for some short time with sick ?
Make we use dis example , see how Abraham be behave time weh yi woman be die .
Bible di talk say : ‘ Abraham be start for di mourn and di cry Sarah . ’
When Bible talk say ih ‘ be start , ’ e di try for show say some time be pass before Abraham stop for di over memba yi woman weh ih be die .
So ih be cry for ‘ plenty day them , ’ and no man for yi family be fit comfort yi .
After plenty year them be pass , Joseph yi die be di still hot yi for heart . ​ — Genesis 23 : 2 ; 37 : 34 , 35 ; 42 : 36 ; 45 : 28 .
“ Ma man Robert , be die for July 9 , 2008 .

A no think say , A go fit stop for di cry ma Robert . ” ​ — Gail , age 60 .
“ Even how weh 18 year don pass weh ma woman no dei with mi , A di still hungry for be with yi and A di still cry say ih be die .
Any time weh A see some fine thing weh God make - am , A di just start think na how ih for like for see - am . ” ​ — Etienne , 84 .
E di show fine say for di feel bad about ya person for long time na thing weh e be normal .
Any man di cry for yi own way , and e no go fine for judge the way weh some other man di feel when ih get problem .
And too , we get for stop for di condemn we self if e be like say we own way for cry e too much .
E di show say even after three year be don pass weh Isaac yi mami be die , ih be di still cry yi mami . ​ — Genesis 24 : 67 .
See this example , you fit see - am say some people go advice you say make you no cry or make you no make - am make people see how you di feel .
But other people fit di tell you na say , make you cry fine so that people go fit see how you di feel .
Bible di give the correct advice weh e go helep we , one weh science don see - am say na true .
For some people them man pikin no get for cry .
But any better reason dei why person get for di shame for cry , even if people di see yi ?
Some doctor weh ih di study how people di think , how they di feel , and how they di act ( mental - health experts ) talk say , e be normal for water for di komot for man yi eye when ih di cry .
And when man cry for some time , e fit helep yi for continue with life , even if ya trouble dei na how .
For hold ya self say you no go cry fit instead do you plenty bad .
Bible no di support the idea say e be wrong for cry or say , man pikin no get for cry .
Jesus be cry yi friend Lazarus for front people them , even as ih be get power for make die people for weikop for die ! ​ — John 11 : 33 - 35 .
For di vex na thing weh e di happen plenty time when some man di cry , especially when yi person die weh ih no be di expect - am .

For ma papa yi die place , the Anglican priest be talk say God need good people and ih no di leave them for stay for long .

Some people fit over feel so if e be say their person just die weh they no be di expect - am , some man fit di talk for yi self say , ‘ some time ih no for die if A be try ma best . ’
If you di feel for this kind way and you carry vex for ya heart weh e di worry you , e go fine say you talk - am with some person .
Talk with some friend weh ih go listen for you and weh ih go helep you for know say the way weh you di feel na thing weh e di happen for all people time weh some man die for them .
Bible di tell we say : ‘ True true friend di show love for all time and ih be na brother weh you go get - am for time for trouble . ’ ​ — Proverbs 17 : 17 .
Na Jehovah , the God weh ih make we be the best Friend weh man weh yi person don die fit get - am .
Make you trouwei all the worry weh you get - am for yi because ‘ Ih di care about you . ’
( 1 Peter 5 : 7 ) Ih don even promise we say , all people weh they turn for yi , ‘ and the peace weh e komot for God weh no person no know how e dei , ’ go make them for feel better .
( Philippians 4 : 6 , 7 ) And too , you fit leave - am make God comfort you with the fine fine talk them for comfort person weh they dei for Bible .
When you di think about this kind scripture them , e fit really helep you time weh no man no dei for ya corner and time weh you no di fit for sleep . ​ — Isaiah 57 : 15 .

Plenty time them A di weikop for night and A no di fit for sleep again .
But after A read and A think deep about the fine talk them for Bible and then A pray , A di feel as ma mind go quiet and ma heart go cool and e go make - am A go fit for sleep . ”

Vanessa too don see weiti weh prayer fit do for person .
Ih talk say : “ Time weh A no di fit for hold ma heart again , A go just memba ma God , Jehovah and then burst cry .
Jehovah be di hear ma prayer them and ih be di give me the power weh A need - am . ”
Some doctor them weh they di advice people weh their person don die , di talk say when they give their self for do work weh e go helep other people , e di helep them for continue with life .
When they do so , e go make them for be happy and go make them for no over feel bad .
( Acts 20 : 35 ) Plenty Christian them weh their people them don die , don see - am say for di do something for helep other people don over comfort them . ​ — 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 .
When you di suffer , God di feel - am . ​ — Psalm 55 : 22 ; 1 Peter 5 : 7 .

You don ever feel say you no know thing for do time weh some person for ya corner di cry yi person weh ih don die ?
Some time them , we di just be quiet because we no know thing for talk or weiti for do - am .
But plenty thing them dei weh we fit do - am for helep them .
For some time them , the only thing weh the person need - am na say make you be with yi and tell yi some fine talk like , “ ashia . ”
For plenty culture them , for embrace person or for hold yi hand tight , na some fine way for show the person say you di feel for yi .
If the person weh ih get die di want for talk with you , listen like say na you be get the problem .
The best thing for do na for helep the family for do some thing like for work some work for house weh they no fit work - am that time . This work fit be na for cook chop , for lukot pikin them , or for helep them for arrange thing them for bury the person if they go like - am .
After some time , you fit like for talk about the person weh ih be die .
You fit like for talk about some fine fashon them weh ih be get - am or some fine thing them weh they be happen with yi .
That kind story them fit even make the person weh ih person don die for smile .
For example , six year don pass since weh Ian , weh na Pam yi man be die . Pam talk say : “ Some time them people them be di tell me good thing them weh ma man be do - am weh A no be ever know - am , and that one be di make ma heart for di glad . ”
People them weh they di do research don write say when some people just lost their person , that time people di helep them plenty . But e no di stay , their friend them di forget about them and di do na their own thing them .
After ya friend yi person die , try for di talk with yi or for di visit yi all time .
* Plenty people them weh they di cry their person , di glad for get this kind comfort after they don cry for some long time .
See example for some young woman for Japan weh yi name na Kaori . Ih be don confuse sotee ih no know thing for do because yi mami be die , and then yi big sister die only after 1 year , 3 month be pass .
We di glad say yi best friend them be support yi .
Ritsuko weh na one for that yi friend them , be old pass Kaori plenty .
Ih be ask Kaori say ih want for be yi tight friend .
A no be want - am make any person take ma mami yi place , and A no be check say some person fit ever take - am .
But because Mama Ritsuko be treat me fine , A be kam like - am for be with yi .
Every week , me and yi be di go preach and we be di go meeting .
Ih be di take me for go drink tea with yi , di bring me chop , and di write letter them and plenty time them , ih be di send me card them .
Mama Ritsuko yi fine fashon be helep me for some fine way . ”
Twelve year them don pass weh Kaori yi mami be die , and as we di talk so , yi and yi man na pioneer them .
Kaori talk say : “ Mama Ritsuko di continue for lukot we .
Any time weh A go back for place weh ih dei , A di visit yi and A di enjoy the encouragement weh ih di give me . ”
Poli na some Jehovah Witness for Cyprus weh yi too be benefit for this kind support .
Poli be get some good man weh ih be di show some fine example like elder for Christian congregation . Yi name be be na Sozos .
( James 1 : 27 ) The bad thing na say , time weh Sozos be dei 53 year , some sick weh they di call - am say brain tumor be kill yi .
For there , they start di go meeting for some congregation for Jehovah Witness them .
Poli di memba say : “ The brother and sister them for ma new congregation no be know any thing weh e be happen for we and they no be even know how weh thing them be di strong for we .
But that one no be stop them for di kam for we corner and di comfort we with their fine fine talk them .
That helep be over be important for this time weh ma pikin be over need yi papa .
Elder them for congregation be really show Daniel say they like yi .
Time weh some one for that brother be di go for enjoy with yi friend them , or for go play football , ih be di ever go with Daniel . ”
Now so , the mami and the pikin dei fine .
Plenty way them dei weh we fit helep and comfort people them weh they di cry their person weh ih don die .
The wonderful thing them weh Bible di promise - am for time weh e di kam , di comfort we too .
Some people them don even mark the day weh their friend be get die for inside their own calender , so that they go memba for comfort their friend time weh ih need - am .
You fit memba Gail , weh we bi talk about yi time weh we start this story , as ih bi di doubt whether ih go fit ever forget about yi man Rob , weh ih be die .
But ih di wait time weh ih go see yi man again for paradise .
A di really sorry for people weh their person don die but weh they no get this hope for kam see their person again . ”
Small time , na thing that weh God go do - am ​ — for Job and for plenty other people them ​ — time weh this earth go bi paradise .
( Luke 23 : 42 , 43 ) Acts 24 : 15 talk say people ‘ go kam weikop for die . ’
Ih go fit for get yi power again like time weh ih bi dei young , so that yi body go ‘ fresh pass when ih bi dei small boy . ’
( Job 33 : 24 , 25 ) Na the same thing go happen for all people weh they di glad with weiti weh God don giv - am , for helep people for get life again .
If you bi don suffer because some ya person bi don die , the thing them weh we don talk - am no fit change the way weh you di feel all all .
But as you di think deep about thing weh God don promise we for Bible , you go see say all thing never lost and you go get power for continue with ya life . ​ — 1 Thessalonians 4 : 13 .
You go like for know plenty other thing them about how you fit control the way you di feel when some ya person die ?
Or you get some question them like this one “ Why God don leave suffer and bad thing them for di happen ? ”
Go for we website , jw.org , for see how Bible di give answer them weh they di helep and di comfort we .
‘ God . . . go wipe their tear for eye , and die no go be again , man no go mourn again , man no go cry again and man no go suffer again . Old thing them don pass . ’ ​ — Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 .
