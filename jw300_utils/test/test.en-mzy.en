Why may those who are new to your congregation need hospitality ?
( Read Luke 10 : 41 , 42 . )
One evening my wife was particularly homesick , and my efforts to help were not working .
Then , about 7 : 30 p.m . , we heard a knock on the door .
There stood a Bible student who brought us three oranges .
She had come to welcome the new missionaries .
We invited her in and gave her a glass of water .
Then we made tea and hot chocolate .

If you feel anxious about having guests , you are not alone .
An elder in Britain admits : “ There can be a measure of nervousness in preparing for guests .
But as with anything in relation to serving Jehovah , the benefits and satisfaction that result far outweigh any anxiety .
I have enjoyed simply sitting down with guests over coffee and talking . ”
Another elder writes : “ Having friends from the congregation to my home helps me to understand them better and gives me time to get to know them , especially how they came into the truth . ”
The wife of one of the instructors really put me at ease .
She said that when she and her husband are serving in the traveling work , their best weeks are those spent staying with a spiritual person who may not have much materially but who has the same focus as they have ​ — serving Jehovah and keeping life simple .
This reminded me of what my mum used to say to us as children : ‘ Better a dish of vegetables where there’s love . ’ ”

( Read Proverbs 25 : 21 , 22 . )
Hosts usually prepare well for their guests ( See paragraph 20 )

It is also important to respect local customs .
Why is it so important to “ be hospitable to one another ” ?

The lesson ?
The elder recalled : “ Graham had a problem with pride .
He was critical of the elders who had been involved in his disfellowshipping .
So for the next few studies , we discussed scriptures on pride and its effects .
Graham began to see himself clearly in the mirror of God’s Word , and he did not like what he saw !
The effect was amazing !
After acknowledging that he had been blinded by a ‘ rafter ’ of pride and that his critical attitude was his problem , he began to change quickly for the better .
He started to attend Christian meetings regularly , to study God’s Word earnestly , and to make daily prayer a habit .
‘ I’ve known the truth for years , ’ he said , ‘ and I’ve even served as a pioneer .
( Read Luke 4 : 22 . )
The apostle Peter wrote : “ Shepherd the flock of God under your care , serving as overseers , not under compulsion , but willingly before God ; not for love of dishonest gain , but eagerly ; not lording it over those who are God’s inheritance , but becoming examples to the flock . ”

Some years later , the daughter was reinstated .
We have a wonderful relationship . ”
( Read 2 Peter 3 : 9 . )
( b ) How can we make the elders ’ work more pleasant for them ?
( Read Hebrews 13 : 7 , 17 . )
They did not berate me or criticize me , but they encouraged me and strengthened me .
After every congregation meeting , no matter how busy they were , at least one of them would ask how I was .
Because of my past , I found it difficult to feel worthy of God’s love .
Time and time again , however , Jehovah has used the congregation and the elders to confirm his love for me .
I pray that I will never let him go . ”
If you turn to doing good , will you not be restored to favor ?
But if you do not turn to doing good , sin is crouching at the door , and its craving is to dominate you ; but will you get the mastery over it ? ”
So let us “ listen to discipline and become wise . ”
