I often feel that these articles are written just for me .
For years , I have been battling a strong desire for something Jehovah hates .
At times , I want to throw my hands up and stop fighting .
I know that Jehovah is merciful and forgiving , but because I have this wrong desire and deep down I don’t hate it , I feel that I am unable to receive his help .
This ongoing battle has affected every aspect of my life . . . .

The first article shows how our faith can grow and remain strong .
As told by Thomas McLain
Let me explain what led to that conversation .
I WAS born in Wichita , Kansas , U.S.A . , on December 10 , 1936 , the oldest of four children .
Then a soldier walked by , and the doctor yelled , “ Do something about this yellow coward ! ”
The soldier could see that the man was drunk , so he told him , “ Go home and sober up ! ”
They both left .
He owned two barbershops in Wichita , and the doctor was one of his clients !
With my parents , going to a convention in Wichita in the 1940 ’ s
With Jehovah’s blessing and their zealous work , a congregation was started .
Finally , an older sister started attending .
F .
We were assigned to special pioneer in Walnut Ridge , Arkansas .
Then in 1962 , we were thrilled to receive an invitation to the 37th class of Gilead .
Soon after , our first daughter , Kimberly , was born , and 17 months later , we had Stephany .
We would also go camping with them and would have very enjoyable conversations around the campfire .
We arranged to have some who were in the full - time ministry stay in our home .
Our daughters really wanted to do that .
They were shocked and started to cry and said that they wanted to study .
With the help and direction of God’s organization , we did our best to raise them to love Jehovah .
On a later trip , Kimberly met one of his workmates , Brian Llewellyn .
So they did stay free until they were at least 23 .
At the same time , Brian and Kimberly were invited to work at London Bethel and later were transferred to Malawi Bethel .
The day after we left for the Watchtower Educational Center in Patterson , Linda called to tell us that Mother had died .
Next , we taught the course in Zimbabwe and then in Zambia .
In 2006 , Brian and Kimberly moved next door to us to raise their two daughters , Mackenzie and Elizabeth .
Paul and Stephany are still in Malawi , where Paul serves on the Branch Committee .

We must recognize that when we prepare for the ministry , for the meetings , or for a talk , we may not necessarily apply what we read to ourselves .
Since my mind is mainly involved in an intellectual exercise , my heart is not necessarily touched by the spiritual thoughts I am reading .
That is why I regularly set aside time to study the Bible and other publications in my mother tongue . ”
“ It annoyed him to go out in the ministry in another language , whereas before he loved preaching in his native language , French , ” says Muriel .
“ When we realized that this situation had hindered our son from making spiritual advancement , ” explains Serge , “ we decided to move back to our former congregation . ”
Make sure that the truth reaches the hearts of your children ( See paragraphs 14 , 15 )
But we also include practice sessions and games in Lingala so that they can learn this language while having fun . ”
Make an effort to learn the local language and to participate in the meetings ( See paragraphs 16 , 17 )

As told by Denton Hopkinson
I was only eight years old at the time .
My father did not want my mother to talk to me about what she was learning .
However , I was curious and asked questions , so she studied with me when my father was out of the house .
As a result , I too decided that I wanted to dedicate my life to Jehovah .
My mother said that I should first speak to the servant to the brethren ( now called a circuit overseer ) .
After four months , I selected a brother as my pioneer partner .
My mother pioneered with a sister in another congregation .
In 1951 , I filled out an application to attend the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead .
While there , I received my invitation to the 22nd class of Gilead .
I then traveled by train to South Lansing , New York , where the school was located .

( b ) What questions will we consider ?
How , though , does the hope of a reward benefit us ?
( Read Matthew 6 : 33 . )
Jesus showed that his disciples would be rewarded for their sacrifices ( See paragraph 5 )
The apostle Peter once asked Jesus : “ We have left all things and followed you ; what , then , will there be for us ? ”
In the Sermon on the Mount , Jesus said : “ Rejoice and be overjoyed , since your reward is great in the heavens , for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you . ”
Moses told the nation of Israel : “ Jehovah will surely bless you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance , but only if you strictly obey the voice of Jehovah your God and carefully observe all this commandment that I am giving you today .
For Jehovah your God will bless you just as he has promised you . ”
How did Jehovah reward Joseph ?
Not at all !
And he named the second one Ephraim , for he said , ‘ God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction . ’ ”
God’s Word explains : “ For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake , despising shame . ”
Jesus certainly found joy in being able to sanctify God’s name .
How does Jehovah feel about what we do for him ?
“ The one showing favor to the lowly is lending to Jehovah , and He will repay him for what he does . ”
And he promises to reward that kindness .
( Read 1 John 3 : 19 , 20 . )
What are some of the rewards that we enjoy now ?
How do Jehovah’s servants feel about the rewards they receive ?
For example , Bianca from Germany says : “ I cannot thank Jehovah enough for helping me with my worries and for being at my side each day .
Whenever I make personal sacrifices for him , he gives me back a hundredfold in blessings . ”
For my own encouragement , I keep a notebook with scriptures and thoughts from our publications that I can consult from time to time .
I call it ‘ My Survival Notebook . ’
Discouragement is temporary if we focus on Jehovah’s promises .
Jehovah is always there to help us , regardless of our circumstances . ”
