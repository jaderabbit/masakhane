It comforts people with the good news that God’s heavenly Kingdom will soon end all wickedness and transform the earth into a paradise .
It promotes faith in Jesus Christ , who died so that we might gain everlasting life and who is now ruling as King of God’s Kingdom .
This magazine has been published continuously since 1879 and is nonpolitical .

Bebe had been very close to her father .
The remark came from a well - meaning family friend , but Bebe found it more cutting than comforting .
“ His death wasn’t for the best , ” she kept repeating to herself .
It was clear that when Bebe recounted the incident in a book years later , she was still grieving .
As Bebe came to see , it can take a long time for someone to overcome grief , especially when the bereaved person was very close to the deceased .
In the Bible , death is aptly described as “ the last enemy . ”
It breaks into our lives with irresistible force , often when we are completely unprepared , and it robs us of those we hold dear .
None of us are immune to its ravages .
So it is not surprising if we feel at a loss when it comes to coping with death and its aftermath .
Perhaps you have wondered : ‘ How long does it take to get over grief ?
How can I comfort others who have been bereaved ?
Is there any hope for our loved ones who have died ? ’
Have you ever had a brief bout with illness ?
As an example , consider how the patriarch Abraham reacted when his wife died .
The Bible says that “ Abraham began to mourn and to weep over Sarah . ”
The expression “ began to ” suggests that it took some time for him to cope with his loss .
He grieved for “ many days , ” and his family members were unable to comfort him .
Several years later , the death of Joseph still weighed heavily on his mind . ​ — Genesis 23 : 2 ; 37 : 34 , 35 ; 42 : 36 ; 45 : 28 .
“ My husband , Robert , died on July 9 , 2008 .
Six years later the pain in my heart is still there .
I don’t think I will ever get over my loss of Rob . ” ​ — Gail , aged 60 .
“ Although I have been without my dear wife for more than 18 years , I still miss her and grieve over my loss .
Whenever I see something in nature that is attractive , my thoughts go to her , and I cannot help wondering how she would have enjoyed seeing what I am seeing . ” ​ — Etienne , aged 84 .
Clearly , such painful and long - lasting feelings are only natural .
Each person grieves in his or her own way , and it would be unwise to judge the way another person responds to tragedy .
At the same time , we may need to hold off from condemning ourselves if our reaction to loss seems excessive .
As we note in the “ Imitate Their Faith ” article in this issue , Isaac was still grieving over the loss of his mother , Sarah , three years after her death . ​ — Genesis 24 : 67 .
For instance , you may find that some will advise you not to cry or show your feelings in any way .
Others may push you to do the opposite and expose all your feelings .
The Bible presents a more balanced view , one that is supported by modern research .
In some cultures it is considered unmanly for a male to cry .
But is there a real need to feel ashamed about shedding tears , even in public ?
Mental - health experts acknowledge that tearfulness is a normal part of grieving .
And grieving may , in time , help you to move on despite the enormity of your loss .
Suppressing grief , however , may do more harm than good .
The Bible lends no support to the notion that it is wrong or unmanly to shed tears of grief .
At the death of his dear friend Lazarus , Jesus openly wept , even though he had the power to bring the dead back to life ! ​ — John 11 : 33 - 35 .
Bouts of anger are often part of grieving , especially in cases of sudden , unexpected death .
There are many reasons why a bereaved person may feel angry , such as when thoughtless and unfounded comments are made by a respected person .
“ I was only 14 years old when my father died , ” explains a South African man named Mike .
“ At the funeral , the Anglican minister said that God needs good people and takes them early .
* This angered me because we desperately needed our father .
Especially in the case of unexpected death , the bereaved person may repeatedly think , ‘ It might not have happened if only I had done this or that . ’
If you are being plagued by such feelings of guilt and anger , it is important not to bottle up these emotions .
Rather , speak to a friend who will listen and reassure you that such irrational feelings are common to many bereaved ones .
The Bible reminds us : “ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of distress . ” ​ — Proverbs 17 : 17 .
The best Friend a bereaved person can have is our Creator , Jehovah God .
Pour out your heart to him in prayer because “ he cares for you . ”
Moreover , he promises that all who do so will have their thoughts and feelings soothed by “ the peace of God that surpasses all understanding . ”
Also , allow God to help you heal by means of his consoling Word , the Bible .
Having such thoughts to ponder over may be especially helpful at night when you are alone and find it hard to sleep . ​ — Isaiah 57 : 15 .
Recently , a 40 - year - old man , whom we will call Jack , lost his beloved wife to cancer .
“ When I pray to Jehovah , ” he explains , “ I never feel alone .
I often wake up during the night and cannot get back to sleep .
After reading and meditating on comforting thoughts from the Scriptures and then pouring out the feelings of my heart in prayer , I sense a calmness and a transcending peace come over me , putting my mind and heart at rest and enabling me to sleep . ”
A young woman named Vanessa lost her mother to illness .
She too has experienced the power of prayer .
“ In my most difficult times , ” she says , “ I would just call on God’s name and break down in tears .
Jehovah listened to my prayers and always gave me the strength I needed . ”
Some bereavement counselors advise those who are struggling with grief to get involved in helping others or to volunteer their time in some community service .
Doing so can bring joy and may ease a person’s grief .
Many bereaved Christians have found that working to help others has brought them great comfort . ​ — 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 .
God feels for you in your pain . ​ — Psalm 55 : 22 ; 1 Peter 5 : 7 .
God patiently listens to the prayers of his servants . ​ — Psalm 86 : 5 ; 1 Thessalonians 5 : 17 .
God misses people who have died . ​ — Job 14 : 13 - 15 .
God promises to resurrect the dead . ​ — Isaiah 26 : 19 ; John 5 : 28 , 29 .
Have you ever felt helpless when someone near to you was grieving over the loss of a loved one ?
Sometimes we may feel unsure of what to say or do ​ — so we wind up saying and doing nothing .
But there are practical , helpful things that we can do .
Often , all that is needed is your presence along with a simple expression , such as “ I am so sorry . ”
In many cultures , giving the person a hug or a gentle squeeze of the arm is an effective way to show you care .
If the bereaved one wants to talk , listen sympathetically .
Best of all , do something for the bereaved family , perhaps performing a chore the grieving one has not been able to care for , such as cooking a meal , caring for the children , or helping with funeral arrangements if that is desired .
Such actions may speak louder than the most eloquent words .
In time , you may be moved to talk about the deceased , perhaps focusing on some good qualities or happy experiences .
Such conversation may even bring a smile to the bereaved person’s face .
For example , Pam ​ — who lost her husband , Ian , six years ago — ​ says : “ People sometimes tell me good things that Ian did that I never knew about , and that makes my heart feel good . ”
Researchers report that many bereaved people receive a lot of initial help but that their needs are soon forgotten as friends get busy again with their own lives .
Therefore , make a point of contacting a bereaved friend on a regular basis after the loss .
* Many grieving ones deeply appreciate this opportunity to relieve themselves of prolonged feelings of grief .
Consider the example of Kaori , a young Japanese woman who was devastated by the loss of her mother followed by the loss of her older sister 15 months later .
Thankfully , she received ongoing support from loyal friends .
One named Ritsuko is much older than Kaori and offered to be her close friend .
“ To be honest , ” says Kaori , “ I wasn’t happy about that .
I didn’t want anyone to take the place of my mother , and I didn’t think that anyone could .
However , because of the way Mama Ritsuko treated me , I came to feel close to her .
Every week , we went out in the evangelizing work together and went to Christian meetings together .
She invited me to have tea with her , brought me meals , and wrote me letters and cards many times .
Mama Ritsuko’s positive attitude had a good influence on me . ”
Twelve years have passed since Kaori’s mother died , and today she and her husband are full - time evangelizers .
“ Mama Ritsuko , ” Kaori says , “ continues to show her concern .
When I go back home , I always visit her and enjoy her upbuilding association . ”
Another example of someone who benefited from ongoing support is Poli , one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Cyprus .
Poli had a kind husband , Sozos , who set a good example as a Christian shepherd by often inviting orphans and widows to their home for association and a meal .
Sadly , at the age of 53 , Sozos died of a brain tumor .
There , they began associating with a congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
“ The friends in my new congregation , ” recalls Poli , “ did not know anything about our past and our difficult circumstances .
But that did not stop them from approaching us and embracing us with their kind words and practical help .
How precious that help was , especially at that time , when my son needed his father most !
Those taking the lead in the congregation showed a great deal of personal interest in Daniel .
One in particular made sure to include Daniel when enjoying association with friends or when going out to play ball . ”
Both mother and son are doing well today .
To be sure , there are many ways we can offer practical help and comfort to those who mourn .
The Bible also comforts us by means of a thrilling hope for the future .
Some have even marked the date of the death on their calendar as a reminder to offer comfort when it may be most needed ​ — on or near the date of the loss .
You may recall that Gail , mentioned earlier in this series , doubts whether she will ever get over the death of her husband , Rob .
However , she is looking forward to seeing him again in God’s promised new world .
My feelings really go out to people who have lost someone they love but who are not aware of this hope of seeing their loved one again . ”
Soon , God will do just that ​ — for Job and countless others — ​ when this earth is transformed into a paradise .
“ There is going to be a resurrection , ” the Bible confirms at Acts 24 : 15 .
“ Do not be amazed at this , ” Jesus assures us , “ for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out . ”
He will have the prospect of regaining “ his youthful vigor , ” and his flesh will forever remain “ fresher than in youth . ”
The same will happen to all who respond with appreciation to God’s merciful provision of a resurrection to life on earth .
If you have suffered the loss of someone dear to you , the information we have discussed may not completely take away your grief .
But by meditating on God’s promises found in the Bible , you can find real hope and the strength to keep going . ​ — 1 Thessalonians 4 : 13 .

COVER SUBJECT | WHY DID JESUS SUFFER AND DIE ?
In the spring of 33 C.E . , Jesus the Nazarene was executed .
He had been falsely charged with sedition , savagely beaten , and nailed to a stake .
But God raised him back to life , and 40 days later , Jesus ascended to heaven .
This extraordinary account comes to us from the four Gospels of the Christian Greek Scriptures , commonly called the New Testament .
On the other hand , if those events really did happen , then there is a bright future for mankind , one in which you can share .
So , are the Gospel accounts fact or fiction ?
Unlike fanciful legends , the Gospel writings reflect painstaking accuracy and attention to detail .
For example , they abound with names of real places , many of which can be visited today .
They tell about real people , whose existence has been corroborated by secular historians . ​ — Luke 3 : 1 , 2 , 23 .
Jesus himself is mentioned by secular writers of the first and second centuries .
* His manner of death , as described in the Gospels , agrees with Roman executional methods of the time .
Moreover , events are related in a factual and candid manner ​ — even portraying some of Jesus ’ disciples unfavorably .
All these factors strongly indicate that the Gospel writers were honest and accurate in what they wrote about Jesus .
While it is generally accepted that Jesus lived and died , some would question his resurrection .
Even his apostles did not believe the initial report of his having returned to life .
All doubt was removed , however , when they and other disciples saw the resurrected Jesus on separate occasions .
In fact , in one case , there were more than 500 eyewitnesses present . ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 6 .
At the risk of being arrested and killed , the disciples courageously proclaimed Jesus ’ resurrection to all ​ — even to the very ones who had executed him .
Would so many disciples have been so bold if they were not absolutely sure that Jesus had really been resurrected ?
In fact , the reality of the resurrection of Jesus is the driving force behind the impact that Christianity has had on the world both then and now .
The Gospel accounts of Jesus ’ death and resurrection bear all the necessary marks of an authentic historical record .
Carefully reading them will convince you that these events really happened .
Your conviction can be further strengthened when you understand why they took place .
Tacitus , born about 55 C.E . , wrote that “ Christus , from whom the name [ Christians ] had its origin , suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators , Pontius Pilatus . ”
Jesus is also referred to by Suetonius ( first century ) ; Jewish historian Josephus ( first century ) ; and Pliny the Younger , governor of Bithynia ( early second century ) .
Then , too , it is unlikely that Jesus ’ many opposers would write anything that would lend credibility to the reports about him .
Regarding Jesus ’ resurrection , Peter , one of his apostles , explained : “ God raised this one up on the third day and allowed him to become manifest , not to all the people , but to witnesses appointed beforehand by God , to us , who ate and drank with him after his rising from the dead . ”
Matthew’s Gospel tells us that when the religious enemies heard reports of Jesus ’ resurrection , they schemed to suppress them . ​ — Matthew 28 : 11 - 15 .
Does this mean that Jesus wanted his resurrection to be kept secret ?
No , for Peter went on to say : “ He ordered us to preach to the people and to give a thorough witness that this is the one decreed by God to be judge of the living and the dead . ”
True Christians have done and are doing just that . ​ — Acts 10 : 42 .
“ Through one man [ Adam ] sin entered into the world and death through sin . ” ​ — Romans 5 : 12
What would you say if you were asked , “ Do you want to live forever ? ”
Most people would probably say that they want to but that they feel it is unrealistic to consider it .
Death is a normal part of life , they say , the natural outcome of our existence .
Suppose , though , that the question were turned around and you were asked , “ Are you ready to die ? ”
Under normal circumstances , most people would answer no .
The Bible shows that God created humans with the desire and the will to live .
In fact , it says that “ he has even put eternity in their heart . ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 3 : 11 .
The reality , though , is that humans do not live forever .
Furthermore , has God done anything to remedy the situation ?
The Bible’s answers are heartening , and they have a direct bearing on why Jesus suffered and died .
The first three chapters of the Bible book of Genesis tell us that God set before the first human couple , Adam and Eve , the prospect of unending life and told them what they would have to do to gain it .
Then the account describes how they failed to obey God and lost that prospect .
The story is told simply ​ — so simply that some are quick to dismiss it as folklore .
But Genesis , like the Gospels , gives every indication of being a factual , historical record .
What has been the result of Adam’s failure to obey ?
The Bible answers this way : “ Through one man [ Adam ] sin entered into the world and death through sin , and so death spread to all men because they had all sinned . ”
He thus lost the prospect of endless life and eventually died .
Being his descendants , we have inherited his sinful condition .
But has God done anything to remedy the situation ?
Yes , God made arrangements to redeem , or buy back , what Adam had lost for his descendants , namely , the prospect of endless life .
“ The wages sin pays is death , ” says the Bible at Romans 6 : 23 .
This means that death is the consequence of sin .
Likewise , we sin and are therefore subject to sin’s wages , death .
But we were born in this sinful condition through no fault of our own .
So God lovingly sent his Son , Jesus , to accept ‘ the wages of sin ’ for us .
Jesus ’ death opens the way to a happy , endless life
Since one man , the perfect man Adam , brought sin and death on us through disobedience , a perfect man obedient even till death was needed to release us from that burden .
The Bible explains it this way : “ Just as through the disobedience of the one man many were made sinners , so also through the obedience of the one person many will be made righteous . ”
He left heaven , became a perfect man * , and died in our behalf .
As a result , it is possible for us to have a righteous standing with God and gain the prospect of endless life .
Why , though , was it necessary for Jesus to die to accomplish this ?
Could not Almighty God have simply issued a decree that Adam’s descendants be allowed to live forever ?
Had God set justice aside in this instance , people might have wondered whether he would do so in other matters as well .
For example , would he be fair in determining who among Adam’s offspring qualify for eternal life ?
Could he be trusted to keep his promises ?
God’s adherence to justice in working out our salvation is assurance to us that he will always do what is right .
By Jesus ’ sacrificial death , God opened the way to endless life in Paradise on earth .
Note Jesus ’ words as recorded at John 3 : 16 : “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - begotten Son , so that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life . ”
Jesus ’ death is thus an expression not only of God’s unfailing justice but , more specially , of his great love for humans .
However , why did Jesus have to suffer and die in the painful way that was described in the Gospels ?
By subjecting himself to the extreme test and remaining faithful , Jesus refuted once and for all the Devil’s claim that humans would not remain loyal to God when under trial .
That claim might have seemed valid after Satan induced perfect Adam to sin .
But Jesus ​ — who was Adam’s perfect equivalent — ​ remained obedient despite severe suffering .
He thus proved that Adam too could have obeyed God if he had chosen to do so .
By enduring under trial , Jesus left us a model to follow .
God rewarded his Son’s perfect obedience , granting Jesus immortal life in heaven .
Jesus indicated what we need to do when he said : “ This means everlasting life , their coming to know you , the only true God , and the one whom you sent , Jesus Christ . ” ​ — John 17 : 3 .

WOULD YOU SAY that the Devil is . . .
A symbol of the evil inside a person ?
The Devil conversed with and “ tempted ” Jesus .
WHAT ELSE CAN WE LEARN FROM THE BIBLE ?
The Devil was originally a holy angel , but “ he did not stand fast in the truth . ”
He became a liar and rebelled against God .
Other angels joined Satan’s rebellion . ​ — Revelation 12 : 9 .
The Devil blinds many people to his existence . ​ — 2 Corinthians 4 : 4 .
SOME PEOPLE SAY that control by the Devil is a hoax , while others dread being possessed by evil spirits .
“ The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one . ”
The Devil exerts great influence over mankind , but he does not control every human .

[ 1 ] ( paragraph 14 ) See chapter 21 of the book God’s Kingdom Rules !
During an assembly , a brother asked me if I would like to preach .
We went to the territory , and he gave me some booklets about God’s Kingdom .
One of the sisters there gave us children Bible lessons based on the Bible and the book The Harp of God .
As a teenager , I enjoyed giving people hope from God’s Word .
The brother stopped his bicycle and asked me to sit down with him on a log .
He said : “ Who gave you authority to judge who is a goat ?
Let’s just be happy giving people the good news and leave the judging to Jehovah . ”
Another older brother taught me that to find happiness in giving , we sometimes have to endure patiently .
Years later , his patience was rewarded when his wife was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
After the war , I pioneered for two years in southern Ireland .
We did not realize how much power the priests had .
I had never sailed before , so I was excited .
For five years , we preached mainly on isolated islands where there were no Witnesses .
The crew of missionaries aboard the Sibia ( left to right ) : Ron Parkin , Dick Ryde , Gust Maki , and Stanley Carter
Often , they gave us fresh fish , avocados , and peanuts .
Then at dusk we rang the ship’s bell .
It was lovely to see how seriously some of them took their assignment .
When we arrived , I met and fell in love with Maxine Boyd , a beautiful missionary sister .
So I said to myself , ‘ Ronald , if you want this girl , you’ve got to act quickly . ’
After three weeks I proposed , and after six weeks we were married .
Maxine and I were assigned as missionaries to Puerto Rico , so I never went out on the new boat .
For example , in the village of Potala Pastillo , there were two Witness families with many children , and I used to play the flute for them .
I asked one of the little girls , Hilda , if she wanted to come and preach with us .
We bought her a pair , and she came preaching with us .
She was about to leave for her assignment in Ecuador , and she said : “ You don’t recognize me , do you ?
I am the little girl from Pastillo who had no shoes . ”
At first , Lennart Johnson and I did most of the work .
Nathan Knorr , who was then taking the lead among Jehovah’s Witnesses , came to Puerto Rico .
Later , he gave me strong counsel about being organized and said that he was disappointed in me .
Father did not accept the truth when Mother and I did .
My dear wife , Maxine , died in 2011 .
I am really looking forward to seeing her again in the resurrection .
After 60 years on the island , I felt as Puerto Rican as a coquí , the popular little Puerto Rican tree frog that sings ko - kee , ko - kee at dusk .
Some who come to see me want to discuss personal or family problems .
Everything we do at Bethel is sacred service .
Wherever we serve Jehovah , we have opportunities to praise him .

The soldier could see that the man was drunk , so he told him , “ Go home and sober up ! ”

We would also go camping with them and would have very enjoyable conversations around the campfire .
We arranged to have some who were in the full - time ministry stay in our home .
They were shocked and started to cry and said that they wanted to study .

What can we learn from the way Jehovah , Jesus , and Paul encouraged others ?
What can we learn from the way Jesus treated his apostles ?
After going through those regions and giving many words of encouragement to the ones there , he arrived in Greece . ”
( Read 1 Thessalonians 5 : 12 , 13 . )

What are some reasons why we should be thankful to Jehovah ?
There are many reasons why we should be thankful to Jehovah !
It also shows how the hope of a reward benefits us .
I was only eight years old at the time .
My father did not want my mother to talk to me about what she was learning .
However , I was curious and asked questions , so she studied with me when my father was out of the house .
As a result , I too decided that I wanted to dedicate my life to Jehovah .
My mother said that I should first speak to the servant to the brethren ( now called a circuit overseer ) .
He said , “ Go for it ! ”
After four months , I selected a brother as my pioneer partner .
My mother pioneered with a sister in another congregation .
In 1951 , I filled out an application to attend the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead .

How can you experience “ the peace of God ” ?
How can the congregation help you to reduce anxiety ?
( See opening picture . ) ( b ) What will we consider in this article ?
How , though , can you do that ?
The psalmist David begged Jehovah : “ Listen to my prayer , O God . ”
When we are anxious , why is prayer so important ?
( Read Matthew 11 : 28 - 30 . )
What did Jesus mean when he said : “ Never be anxious ” ?
He admitted : “ My anguished heart makes me groan aloud . ”
( See the box “ Some Practical Ways to Reduce Anxiety . ” )
How can the meaning of God’s name strengthen your faith ?
His very name is understood to mean “ He Causes to Become . ”

How did Jehovah bless his servants in the past ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) How are love and faith connected ?
( b ) What questions will we consider ?
How , though , does the hope of a reward benefit us ?
Jesus showed that his disciples would be rewarded for their sacrifices ( See paragraph 5 )
The apostle Peter once asked Jesus : “ We have left all things and followed you ; what , then , will there be for us ? ”
In the Sermon on the Mount , Jesus said : “ Rejoice and be overjoyed , since your reward is great in the heavens , for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you . ”
Moses told the nation of Israel : “ Jehovah will surely bless you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance , but only if you strictly obey the voice of Jehovah your God and carefully observe all this commandment that I am giving you today .
For Jehovah your God will bless you just as he has promised you . ”
And he named the second one Ephraim , for he said , ‘ God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction . ’ ”
God’s Word explains : “ For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake , despising shame . ”
Jesus certainly found joy in being able to sanctify God’s name .
How does Jehovah feel about what we do for him ?
“ The one showing favor to the lowly is lending to Jehovah , and He will repay him for what he does . ”
What comfort do we find at 1 John 3 : 19 , 20 ?
( Read 1 John 3 : 19 , 20 . )
What are some of the rewards that we enjoy now ?
How do Jehovah’s servants feel about the rewards they receive ?
For example , Bianca from Germany says : “ I cannot thank Jehovah enough for helping me with my worries and for being at my side each day .
The world out there is chaotic and bleak .
But as I work closely with Jehovah , I feel secure in his arms .
Whenever I make personal sacrifices for him , he gives me back a hundredfold in blessings . ”
For my own encouragement , I keep a notebook with scriptures and thoughts from our publications that I can consult from time to time .
I call it ‘ My Survival Notebook . ’
Discouragement is temporary if we focus on Jehovah’s promises .
Jehovah is always there to help us , regardless of our circumstances . ”
Yet , you can likely think of ways in which Jehovah has rewarded you and those around you .
How were Paul and others set free from sin and death ?
( Read Romans 6 : 1 , 2 . )
What choice does each of us have to make ?
He wrote : “ I am fleshly , sold under sin .
( Read Romans 7 : 21 - 23 . )
( Read Proverbs 14 : 5 ; Ephesians 4 : 25 . )
They receive “ the spirit ” as ones “ waiting for adoption as sons , the release from [ their fleshly ] bodies . ”

Opposition to our preaching ( See paragraphs 6 - 9 )
6 , 7 . ( a ) What could Noah not do ?
( b ) How are we in a situation similar to Noah’s ?
We too live in a world filled with wickedness , which we know Jehovah has promised to destroy .
In the meantime , we cannot force people to accept the “ good news of the Kingdom . ”
What Noah could do : Instead of giving up because of what he could not do , Noah focused on what he could do .
When that happened , how did David react ?
Past sins ( See paragraphs 11 - 14 )
11 , 12 . ( a ) After he sinned , what could David not do ?
What David could not do : David could not undo what he had done .
He had to trust that when he truly repented , Jehovah would forgive him and help him endure the consequences of his actions .
( Read James 5 : 14 - 16 . )
He had to leave the matter in Jehovah’s hands .
( Read Luke 21 : 1 - 4 . )
Consider a brother named Malcolm , who remained faithful until his death in 2015 .
Focus on what you can do , not on what you cannot do . ”

( Read Galatians 6 : 4 , 5 . )
( Read Proverbs 3 : 5 , 6 . )
( Read Ecclesiastes 11 : 4 - 6 . )
What will help us to remain modest forever ?
Why is it difficult for some to delegate authority ?
He told Nathan to tell David : “ You are not the one who will build the house for me to dwell in . ”
( Read Numbers 11 : 24 - 29 . )
No , I wish that all of Jehovah’s people were prophets and that Jehovah would put his spirit on them ! ”
( Read Philippians 2 : 20 - 22 . )
I told the officer that I had already been in prison because I would not fight .
I WAS born in 1926 in Crooksville , Ohio , in the United States .
Father and Mother were not religious , but they told us eight children to go to church .
Margaret Walker ( second sister from the left ) helped me learn the truth
About that time , a neighbor named Margaret Walker , one of Jehovah’s Witnesses , began visiting my mother and talking to her about the Bible .
But I kept trying to listen to their discussions .
After a couple more visits , Margaret asked me , “ Do you know what God’s name is ? ”
I said , “ Everyone knows that ​ — it’s God . ”
She said , “ Get your Bible and look up Psalm 83 : 18 . ”
I did , and I discovered that God’s name is Jehovah .
I ran out to my friends and told them , “ When you get home tonight , look up Psalm 83 : 18 in the Bible and see what God’s name is . ”
You might say I started witnessing right away .
I studied the Bible and got baptized in 1941 .
Soon afterward , I was assigned to conduct a congregation book study .
I encouraged my mother and siblings to come , and they all began attending the book study that I conducted .
Sometimes when she was on her way , he chased after her and pulled her back into the house .
But she would just run out the other door and go to the meeting .
I also told the officials that I would not become a soldier .
In court two weeks later , the judge said : “ If it were up to me , I’d give you a life sentence .
I replied : “ Your Honor , I should have been classified as a minister .
Everyone’s doorstep is my pulpit , and I have preached the good news of the Kingdom to many people . ”
The judge told the jury : “ You are not here to decide whether this young man is a minister or not .
You are here to decide whether he reported for induction into the army or not . ”
I prayed to Jehovah : “ I cannot stay in a cell for five years .
The next day , the guards let me out .
I walked over to a tall , broad - shouldered prisoner , and we stood there looking out a window .
He asked me , “ What are you in for , Shorty ? ”
I said , “ I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses . ”
I said , “ Jehovah’s Witnesses don’t go to war and kill people . ”
I said , “ No , it doesn’t . ”
Then he said , “ For 15 years I was in another prison , where I read some of your literature . ”
I was among the Witnesses imprisoned for neutrality at Ashland , Kentucky
That is how we preached in an organized way .
I worried about my family because Dad had told me , “ If I can get rid of you , I can handle the rest . ”
After my release , I had a pleasant surprise .
I said , “ That’s fine , but I am not going into the army . ”
I quoted 2 Timothy 2 : 3 and said , “ I am already a soldier of Christ . ”
After a long silence , he said , “ You can leave . ”
Soon afterward , I attended the Bethel meeting at a convention in Cincinnati , Ohio .
I also worked at Assembly Halls in New York City .
I have made many friends at Bethel and in the congregation .
I have learned a little Mandarin Chinese and enjoy approaching Chinese people on the street .
Some mornings I place 30 or 40 magazines with interested ones .
Preaching to the Chinese people in Brooklyn , New York
I have even made a return visit in China !
She took them and told me that her name was Katie .
After that , whenever she saw me , Katie came over to talk to me .
I taught her the names of fruits and vegetables in English , and she repeated the words after me .
I also explained Bible texts to her , and she accepted the Bible Teach book .
After some weeks , though , she disappeared .
The next week , she handed me her cell phone and said , “ You talk to China . ”
I said , “ I don’t know anybody in China . ”
But she insisted , so I took the phone and said , “ Hello , this is Robison . ”
The voice at the other end said , “ Robby , this is Katie .
Please teach her the way you taught me . ”
I said , “ Katie , I will do the best I can .
Thanks for letting me know where you are . ”
Soon afterward , I spoke to Katie’s sister for the last time .
If it is God’s will , my family members and friends who have died will return to life in the new world .
