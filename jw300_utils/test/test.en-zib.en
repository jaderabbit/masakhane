For example , John explained : “ The one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life ; the one who disobeys the Son will not see life , but the wrath of God remains upon him . ”
Compared with love , how important is faith ?
James asked his anointed brothers : “ Did not God choose those who are poor from the world’s standpoint to be rich in faith and heirs of the Kingdom , which he promised to those who love him ? ”
What hope did Jehovah give his people , and why was this promise remarkable ?

So it does not really seem that Jehovah’s people entered into captivity to Babylon the Great in 1918 .
( Read Matthew 13 : 24 , 25 , 37 - 39 . )

When were the anointed freed from Babylonian captivity ?
Brother Rutherford requested that we arrange conventions in several cities in the western United States and send speakers to try to encourage the friends as much as possible . ”

So I cry often and prefer not to talk to them .
He listened with sympathy as I expressed my feelings .
Then he reminded me of the good I was accomplishing .
He also reminded me of Jesus ’ words ​ — that each of us is worth more than many sparrows .
I often recall that scripture , and it still touches my heart .
( b ) What will we consider in this article ?
What can we learn from the way Jehovah , Jesus , and Paul encouraged others ?
( Read Ecclesiastes 4 : 9 , 10 . )

How did the congregations benefit from following the direction of the governing body ?
( Read 3 John 9 , 10 . )
( Read Matthew 5 : 23 , 24 ; 18 : 15 - 17 . )

It also shows how the hope of a reward benefits us .
How can you experience “ the peace of God ” ?
How can the congregation help you to reduce anxiety ?
( See opening picture . ) ( b ) What will we consider in this article ?
How , though , can you do that ?
The psalmist David begged Jehovah : “ Listen to my prayer , O God . ”
When we are anxious , why is prayer so important ?
What did Jesus mean when he said : “ Never be anxious ” ?
He admitted : “ My anguished heart makes me groan aloud . ”
( See the box “ Some Practical Ways to Reduce Anxiety . ” )
How can the meaning of God’s name strengthen your faith ?
His very name is understood to mean “ He Causes to Become . ”

How can we be sure that Jehovah rewards his servants ?
How did Jehovah bless his servants in the past ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) How are love and faith connected ?
( b ) What questions will we consider ?
How , though , does the hope of a reward benefit us ?
Jesus showed that his disciples would be rewarded for their sacrifices ( See paragraph 5 )
The apostle Peter once asked Jesus : “ We have left all things and followed you ; what , then , will there be for us ? ”
In the Sermon on the Mount , Jesus said : “ Rejoice and be overjoyed , since your reward is great in the heavens , for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you . ”
Moses told the nation of Israel : “ Jehovah will surely bless you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance , but only if you strictly obey the voice of Jehovah your God and carefully observe all this commandment that I am giving you today .
For Jehovah your God will bless you just as he has promised you . ”
And he named the second one Ephraim , for he said , ‘ God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction . ’ ”
God’s Word explains : “ For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake , despising shame . ”
Jesus certainly found joy in being able to sanctify God’s name .
How does Jehovah feel about what we do for him ?
“ The one showing favor to the lowly is lending to Jehovah , and He will repay him for what he does . ”
What comfort do we find at 1 John 3 : 19 , 20 ?
( Read 1 John 3 : 19 , 20 . )
What are some of the rewards that we enjoy now ?
How do Jehovah’s servants feel about the rewards they receive ?
For example , Bianca from Germany says : “ I cannot thank Jehovah enough for helping me with my worries and for being at my side each day .
The world out there is chaotic and bleak .
But as I work closely with Jehovah , I feel secure in his arms .
Whenever I make personal sacrifices for him , he gives me back a hundredfold in blessings . ”
For my own encouragement , I keep a notebook with scriptures and thoughts from our publications that I can consult from time to time .
I call it ‘ My Survival Notebook . ’
Discouragement is temporary if we focus on Jehovah’s promises .
Jehovah is always there to help us , regardless of our circumstances . ”
Yet , you can likely think of ways in which Jehovah has rewarded you and those around you .
How were Paul and others set free from sin and death ?
What choice does each of us have to make ?
He wrote : “ I am fleshly , sold under sin .
( Read Proverbs 14 : 5 ; Ephesians 4 : 25 . )

Opposition to our preaching ( See paragraphs 6 - 9 )
6 , 7 . ( a ) What could Noah not do ?
( b ) How are we in a situation similar to Noah’s ?
We too live in a world filled with wickedness , which we know Jehovah has promised to destroy .
In the meantime , we cannot force people to accept the “ good news of the Kingdom . ”
What Noah could do : Instead of giving up because of what he could not do , Noah focused on what he could do .
When that happened , how did David react ?
Past sins ( See paragraphs 11 - 14 )
11 , 12 . ( a ) After he sinned , what could David not do ?
What David could not do : David could not undo what he had done .
He had to trust that when he truly repented , Jehovah would forgive him and help him endure the consequences of his actions .
( Read James 5 : 14 - 16 . )
He had to leave the matter in Jehovah’s hands .
( Read Luke 21 : 1 - 4 . )

( Read Proverbs 3 : 5 , 6 . )
What will help us to remain modest forever ?
Why is it difficult for some to delegate authority ?
He told Nathan to tell David : “ You are not the one who will build the house for me to dwell in . ”
( Read Numbers 11 : 24 - 29 . )

First , holy spirit empowered the governing body .
Third , God’s Word guided the governing body .
Why can we say that Jesus led the early Christians ?
( a ) When did Jesus appoint “ the faithful and discreet slave ” ?
In 1919 , three years after Brother Russell’s death , Jesus appointed “ the faithful and discreet slave . ”
The July 15 , 2013 , issue of The Watchtower explained that “ the faithful and discreet slave ” is a small group of anointed brothers who make up the Governing Body .
So how can we answer Jesus ’ question : “ Who really is the faithful and discreet slave ? ”

( c ) What questions will we consider ?
And why is Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice the key that unlocks the door for God’s purpose to be accomplished ?
What are some gifts that Jehovah gave Adam and Eve ?
But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad , you must not eat from it , for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die . ”
It was as if he were saying : ‘ You mean you cannot do what you want ? ’
But Jehovah is faithful to his own standards ; he never violates them .
( Read Deuteronomy 32 : 4 , 5 . )
Why is the ransom such a precious gift ?
Jehovah provided the ransom at great cost to himself .
When will Jehovah become “ all things to everyone ” ?
Let your will take place , as in heaven , also on earth . ”
How can we show that we love Jehovah’s name ?
( Read 1 Peter 1 : 15 , 16 . )
Why can Jehovah view us as righteous , even though we are imperfect ?
He accepts as his worshippers those who dedicate themselves to him .
What did Jesus mean when he next said : “ Let your will take place ” ?
How does the ransom benefit humans who have died ?
What is God’s will for the “ great crowd ” ?
( a ) What blessings do we now receive from Jehovah ?
( Read Acts 3 : 19 - 21 . )

Why do Jehovah and Christ deserve to be honored ?
Humans were created “ in God’s image . ”
8 , 9 . ( a ) How do Jehovah’s Witnesses view government officials ?
( Read 1 Timothy 5 : 17 . )

Neither be called leaders , for your Leader is one , the Christ .
But the greatest one among you must be your minister .
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled , and whoever humbles himself will be exalted . ”
Why should others not make decisions for us ?
( a ) To make wise decisions , we should have faith in what ?
What will help us to make wise decisions ?
( Read James 1 : 5 - 8 . )
( Read 2 Corinthians 1 : 24 . )
Loving elders help others learn to make their own decisions ( See paragraph 11 )
Elders too should take time to do research .
Will it bring joy and peace to my family ?
And will it show that I am patient and kind ? ’
Why does Jehovah expect us to make our own decisions ?
What does it mean to serve Jehovah with a complete heart ?
Which of the four kings would you like to imitate , and why ?

When we believe that we have personally experienced or observed an injustice , our faith , humility , and loyalty may be tested .
“ The world is passing away and so is its desire , but the one who does the will of God remains forever . ” ​ — 1 JOHN 2 : 17 .
What will Jehovah do about wicked people and corrupt organizations ?
The Bible says : “ The world is passing away . ”

10 , 11 . ( a ) What injustices did Joseph experience ?
( Read Matthew 5 : 23 , 24 ; 18 : 15 . )

Why should we draw even closer to Jehovah if we experience injustice in the congregation ?
How can we show that we have confidence in “ the Judge of all the earth ” ?
What will we consider in the next article ?
See Willi Diehl’s life story , “ Jehovah Is My God , in Whom I Will Trust , ” in the November 1 , 1991 , issue of The Watchtower .
( See opening pictures . ) ( b ) What questions will be answered in this article ?

18 , 19 . ( a ) What have many Christian parents done ?
( b ) What can be said about those who are in special full - time service ?
Special full - time service vow ( See paragraph 19 )
It is not the people but their assignments that are viewed as special .

See the article “ Anxiety About Money ” in the July 1 , 2015 , issue of The Watchtower .
1 , 2 . ( a ) What injustice did Naboth and his sons experience ?
( b ) What two qualities will we consider in this article ?
What kind of man was Naboth , and why did he refuse to sell his vineyard to King Ahab ?
Naboth was faithful to Jehovah at a time when most Israelites were following the bad example of King Ahab and his wife , wicked Queen Jezebel .
Read 1 Kings 21 : 1 - 3 .
He respectfully explained : “ It is unthinkable , from Jehovah’s standpoint , for me to give you the inheritance of my forefathers . ”
Why would humility have been a protection to Naboth’s family and friends ?
( Read Deuteronomy 32 : 3 , 4 . )
( b ) In what ways will humility protect us ?
How will you respond if the elders announce a decision that you do not agree with ?
What account will we now consider , and why ?
How was Peter corrected , and what questions arise ?
In fact , he was later inspired to write two letters that became part of the Bible .
3 Helping “ Foreign Residents ” to “ Serve Jehovah With Rejoicing ”
The second article considers how applying Bible principles will help immigrant parents to make decisions that will benefit their children .
“ We could see people running , shooting .
My parents and 11 of us siblings fled for our lives with only the clothes on our backs .
How did Jesus and many of his disciples become refugees ?
He said : “ When they persecute you in one city , flee to another . ”
( b ) are living in a camp ?
My feet were so swollen that I told my family to go on without me .
My father ​ — not about to abandon me to the rebel forces — ​ carried me .
They gossiped , drank , gambled , stole , and were immoral . ”
( Read 1 John 3 : 17 , 18 . )
( b ) Why do they need our patient help ?
They need to see that we care about them .
( b ) How can refugees show gratitude ?
How can we help our brothers and sisters who are refugees ?
( a ) What temptation do refugees need to resist ?
Finally , he held up the empty bag and said with a smile : ‘ You see ?
This is all you need ! ’ ” ​ — Read 1 Timothy 6 : 8 .
They need to sense Jehovah’s love and compassion among their fellow Christians .
Many of today’s refugees come from countries where our preaching work is restricted .
( b ) What will we consider in the following article ?
She said : “ The brothers there treated them like close relatives , providing food , clothes , shelter , and transportation .
Who else would welcome strangers into their home just because they worship the same God ?
Only Jehovah’s Witnesses ! ” ​ — Read John 13 : 35 .
As soon as possible after a refugee arrives , elders should follow the direction in Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will , chapter 8 , paragraph 30 .
In the meantime , they can ask discreet questions about a refugee’s congregation and ministry to discern his spiritual condition .
“ No greater joy do I have than this : that I should hear that my children go on walking in the truth . ” ​ — 3 JOHN 4 .
How can parents set a good example for their children ?

( b ) What questions will this article discuss ?
“ But after I started school , I began to prefer the local language .
Within a few years , the shift was complete .
I couldn’t understand the meetings , and I didn’t identify with my parents ’ culture . ”
3 , 4 . ( a ) How can parents set a good example for their children ?
( b ) What should parents not expect of their children ?
When your children see you “ seeking first the Kingdom , ” they learn to depend on Jehovah for their daily needs .
Never get so busy that you do not have time for your children .
How may your children benefit from learning your language ?
Parents , if that describes your children , can you learn at least some of the local language ?
A child who communicates best in another spoken language deserves the same concern , would you not agree ?
If that is your situation , you can still help your children to come to know and love Jehovah .
“ But when we saw her studying , praying , and doing her best to conduct family worship every week , we understood that getting to know Jehovah was very important . ”
How can parents help children who may need to study in two languages ?
( a ) Who must decide which language congregation to attend ?
That may not be the case when children do not fully understand the language .
( Read 1 Corinthians 14 : 9 , 11 . )
The answer was not what we personally found convenient .
But when we saw that they were getting little benefit from the meetings in our language , we decided to move to the local - language congregation .
Together , we regularly attended meetings and shared in the ministry .
We also invited local friends to join us for meals and excursions .
All of this helped our children to get to know the brothers and to get to know Jehovah , not only as their God but also as their Father and Friend .
We considered this to be much more important than their mastering our language . ”
Samuel adds : “ To keep ourselves spiritually strong , my wife and I also attended meetings in our language .
Life was very busy , and we were tired .
But we thank Jehovah for blessing our efforts and sacrifices .
Our three children are all serving Jehovah in the full - time ministry . ”
“ I knew the basics of my parents ’ language , but the language spoken at the meetings was over my head , ” recalls Kristina .
“ When I was 12 , I attended a convention in my school language .
For the first time , I understood that what I was hearing was the truth !
Another turning point came when I began to pray in my school language .
I could speak to Jehovah from my heart ! ”
Young people , do you think that you would prefer being part of a local - language congregation ?
“ When my siblings and I got into our teens , we wanted to switch to the local - language congregation , ” says Nadia , who now serves at Bethel .
“ Now we’re grateful that our parents worked hard to teach us their language and kept us in the foreign - language congregation .
It has enriched our lives and broadened our opportunities to help others get to know Jehovah . ”
( b ) How can parents get help in teaching their children the truth ?
( Read Proverbs 1 : 8 ; 31 : 10 , 27 , 28 . )
Still , parents who do not know the local language may need help to reach their children’s heart .
Both children and parents benefit from association with the congregation ( See paragraphs 18 , 19 )
( b ) What must parents continue to do ?
“ When they helped me with student talk assignments for the meeting , I always learned more .
And I enjoyed the leisure activities we shared in as a group . ”
Parents , pray to Jehovah for help , and try your best .
( Read 2 Chronicles 15 : 7 . )

( b ) What valuable lesson did a brother in Thailand learn about his work ?
As a result , it left me almost no time for spiritual matters .
I finally realized that in order to put Kingdom interests first , I needed to change my line of work . ”
“ After planning for about a year , ” he explained , “ I decided to become a street vendor and sell ice cream .
In the beginning , I struggled financially and got discouraged .
When I met my former workmates , they would laugh at me and ask why I thought selling ice cream was better than working with computers in an air - conditioned environment .
I prayed to Jehovah , asking him to help me to cope and to reach my goal of having more time for spiritual activities .
I got better acquainted with my customers ’ tastes and became more skillful in making ice cream .
Soon , I was selling all my ice cream every day .
Actually , I was better - off financially than when I worked with computers .
It has made me happier because I do not have the stress and worry that I had with my former job .
And most important , I now feel closer to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Matthew 5 : 3 , 6 .
After his baptism , he said : “ The only regret I have is that I lost so much time before I realized that serving Jehovah brings far more happiness than pursuing the entertainment offered by this world . ”
Jesus said : “ Where your treasure is , there your heart will be also . ”
Jesus stated that “ no one can slave for two masters . ”
He added : “ You cannot slave for God and for Riches . ”
See the article “ Is Your Recreation Beneficial ? ”

For the most part , I learned by comparing the English and Vietnamese editions of The Watchtower .
I also made friends in a nearby Vietnamese - language congregation .
When I was 18 , I started pioneering .
Later , I attended the Bible School for Single Brothers .
This helped me with my present pioneer assignment , where I am the only elder in a Vietnamese - language group .
Many Vietnamese people are amazed that I have learned their language .

Though the sins of you people should prove to be as scarlet , they will be made white just like snow . ’

Yet , I was , in effect , saying to him : ‘ Your love is not great enough to reach me .
Your Son’s sacrifice is not enough to cover me . ’

But now , at last , by meditating on this gift of the ransom , I began to feel loved by Jehovah . ”
