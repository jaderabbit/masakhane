( See paragraph 13 )

How would being hospitable help them ?
What about you ?
How can we be hospitable at our Christian meetings ?
Why ?
7 , 8 .
( Read 3 John 5 - 8 . )
Give an example .
He writes : “ I hesitated initially because we were newly married and living in a small house .
But having students stay with us was truly a joyous experience .
As newlyweds , we were able to see how happy a couple can be when they serve Jehovah and pursue spiritual goals together . ”
Why may those who are new to your congregation need hospitality ?
( Read Luke 10 : 41 , 42 . )
One evening my wife was particularly homesick , and my efforts to help were not working .
Then , about 7 : 30 p.m . , we heard a knock on the door .
There stood a Bible student who brought us three oranges .
She had come to welcome the new missionaries .
We invited her in and gave her a glass of water .
Then we made tea and hot chocolate .
16 , 17 .
If you feel anxious about having guests , you are not alone .
An elder in Britain admits : “ There can be a measure of nervousness in preparing for guests .
But as with anything in relation to serving Jehovah , the benefits and satisfaction that result far outweigh any anxiety .
I have enjoyed simply sitting down with guests over coffee and talking . ”
Another elder writes : “ Having friends from the congregation to my home helps me to understand them better and gives me time to get to know them , especially how they came into the truth . ”
The wife of one of the instructors really put me at ease .
She said that when she and her husband are serving in the traveling work , their best weeks are those spent staying with a spiritual person who may not have much materially but who has the same focus as they have ​ — serving Jehovah and keeping life simple .
This reminded me of what my mum used to say to us as children : ‘ Better a dish of vegetables where there’s love . ’ ”
18 , 19 .
( Read Proverbs 25 : 21 , 22 . )
Hosts usually prepare well for their guests ( See paragraph 20 )
The psalmist David asked : “ O Jehovah , who may be a guest in your tent ? ”
It is also important to respect local customs .
Why is it so important to “ be hospitable to one another ” ?

No !
The elder recalled : “ Graham had a problem with pride .
He was critical of the elders who had been involved in his disfellowshipping .
So for the next few studies , we discussed scriptures on pride and its effects .
Graham began to see himself clearly in the mirror of God’s Word , and he did not like what he saw !
The effect was amazing !
After acknowledging that he had been blinded by a ‘ rafter ’ of pride and that his critical attitude was his problem , he began to change quickly for the better .
He started to attend Christian meetings regularly , to study God’s Word earnestly , and to make daily prayer a habit .
‘ I’ve known the truth for years , ’ he said , ‘ and I’ve even served as a pioneer .
( Read Luke 4 : 22 . )
The apostle Peter wrote : “ Shepherd the flock of God under your care , serving as overseers , not under compulsion , but willingly before God ; not for love of dishonest gain , but eagerly ; not lording it over those who are God’s inheritance , but becoming examples to the flock . ”

Some years later , the daughter was reinstated .
We have a wonderful relationship . ”
( Read 2 Peter 3 : 9 . )
( b ) How can we make the elders ’ work more pleasant for them ?
( Read Hebrews 13 : 7 , 17 . )
They did not berate me or criticize me , but they encouraged me and strengthened me .
After every congregation meeting , no matter how busy they were , at least one of them would ask how I was .
Because of my past , I found it difficult to feel worthy of God’s love .
Time and time again , however , Jehovah has used the congregation and the elders to confirm his love for me .
I pray that I will never let him go . ”
If you turn to doing good , will you not be restored to favor ?
But if you do not turn to doing good , sin is crouching at the door , and its craving is to dominate you ; but will you get the mastery over it ? ”
So let us “ listen to discipline and become wise . ”

LIFE STORY
I was born in a one - room log cabin in a very small town called Liberty , Indiana , U.S.A .
Later , my mother gave birth to my two younger brothers and my younger sister .
DURING my school years , not much changed .
The town of Liberty was surrounded by small farms , and the basic crop was corn .
It certainly was a mystery to me .
They wanted me to make the military my career .
This time , however , they invited me to come to a Congregation Book Study , a small meeting for Bible study and discussion that was held in their home .
I told them I would think about it .
Years before , when I asked my mother about Jehovah’s Witnesses , she simply said , “ Oh , they worship some old man named Jehovah . ”
But I now felt that my eyes were being opened !
Jesus was a perfect man .
I started pioneering the next year , in 1958 .
I have never regretted that decision .
Gloria was a jewel then , and she is a jewel today .
He told us that Bethel was not accepting married couples at that time .
On the other hand , we had wonderful times with the brothers , and we loved our ministry !
Meanwhile , I started a study with the couple’s daughter and her husband .
Mother and daughter both decided to serve Jehovah and got baptized .
We had dear friends in the white congregation .
The Ku Klux Klan ( KKK ) , an organization that promotes racism and violence , was very active then .
In 1962 , I was invited to attend the Kingdom Ministry School at South Lansing , New York .
However , a telephone company in Pine Bluff had interviewed me for a job .
If they hired me , I would be the first black man to work for that company .
What would I do ?
She said , “ Go to school and learn as much as you can , and come back and teach us ! ”
Here is how Gloria remembers our time in Pine Bluff : “ I fell in love with the territory !
I had 15 to 20 Bible studies .
So we would go in the house - to - house work in the morning and then conduct Bible studies the rest of the day , sometimes until 11 o’clock at night .
He certainly did .
Brother Leon Weaver , now the coordinator of the United States Branch Committee , was appointed to serve as a circuit overseer at the same time .
I was nervous about becoming a circuit overseer .
In those days , a circuit overseer received little training .
R .
One time , the KKK held a march in a town we were visiting in Tennessee .
The following month , we began our Bethel service .
Gloria was a jewel when I married her , and she still is
Gloria and I love Bethel life .
Then in 1999 , I was appointed to be a member of the Governing Body .
LOVE
PATIENCE
KINDNESS
GOODNESS
FAITH

Second , we must pray for God’s holy spirit .
How did he find peace ?
Is that really possible ?
So I greeted her in her own tongue .
Taken by surprise , she asked me , ‘ What is the reason for your visit ? ’
I politely told her that I wished to see the High Commissioner .
She telephoned the official , who came out to meet me and greeted me in the local language .
After that , he carefully listened to me as I explained to him the peaceful activities of the Witnesses . ”
