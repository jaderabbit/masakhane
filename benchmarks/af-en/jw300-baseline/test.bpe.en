This magazine has been publi@@ shed continu@@ ously since 18@@ 7@@ 9 and is n@@ on@@ poli@@ tical .
It ad@@ her@@ es to the Bible as its author@@ ity .
Be@@ be had been very close to her father .
The re@@ mar@@ k came from a well - meaning family friend , but Be@@ be found it more cu@@ tting than com@@ for@@ ting .
“ His death was@@ n@@ ’@@ t for the best , ” she kept re@@ pe@@ ating to her@@ self .
It was clear that when Be@@ be rec@@ oun@@ ted the in@@ ci@@ dent in a book years later , she was still gri@@ ev@@ ing .
As Be@@ be came to see , it can take a long time for someone to over@@ come gri@@ ef , especially when the ber@@ e@@ a@@ ved person was very close to the de@@ ce@@ as@@ ed .
In the Bible , death is ap@@ tly descri@@ bed as “ the last ene@@ my . ”
It bre@@ a@@ ks into our lives with ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble for@@ ce , often when we are comple@@ tel@@ y un@@ pre@@ pared , and it ro@@ bs us of those we hold de@@ ar .
N@@ one of us are im@@ mun@@ e to its ra@@ va@@ ges .
So it is not surpri@@ sing if we feel at a lo@@ ss when it comes to cop@@ ing with death and its af@@ ter@@ mat@@ h .
Per@@ haps you have wonder@@ ed : ‘ How long does it take to get over gri@@ ef ?
How can I com@@ fort others who have been ber@@ e@@ a@@ ved ?
Is there any hope for our loved ones who have died ? ’
Ha@@ ve you ever had a brief b@@ out with ill@@ ness ?
As an example , consider how the pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch Abraham re@@ ac@@ ted when his wife died .
The Bible says that “ Abraham began to m@@ our@@ n and to we@@ ep over S@@ ar@@ ah . ”
He gri@@ ev@@ ed for “ many days , ” and his family members were un@@ able to com@@ fort him .
Se@@ veral years later , the death of Joseph still we@@ ig@@ hed heav@@ ily on his mind . ​ — Genesis 23 : 2 ; 37 : 34 , 35 ; 42 : 36 ; 45 : 28 .
“ My husband , Ro@@ ber@@ t , died on J@@ uly 9 , 200@@ 8 .
Si@@ x years later the pain in my heart is still there .
I don@@ ’@@ t think I will ever get over my lo@@ ss of Ro@@ b . ” ​ — G@@ a@@ il , a@@ ged 60 .
“ Although I have been without my de@@ ar wife for more than 18 years , I still mi@@ ss her and gri@@ e@@ ve over my lo@@ ss .
Wh@@ en@@ ever I see something in nat@@ ure that is at@@ tra@@ ctive , my th@@ ough@@ ts go to her , and I cannot help wonder@@ ing how she would have enjo@@ yed see@@ ing what I am see@@ ing . ” ​ — E@@ tien@@ ne , a@@ ged 8@@ 4 .
C@@ learly , such pa@@ in@@ ful and long - lasting feelings are only natural .
E@@ ach person gri@@ ev@@ es in his or her own way , and it would be un@@ wise to ju@@ dge the way another person respon@@ ds to tra@@ ged@@ y .
At the same time , we may need to hold off from con@@ dem@@ ning ourselves if our re@@ action to lo@@ ss see@@ ms exc@@ essi@@ ve .
As we note in the “ I@@ mit@@ ate Their Fa@@ ith ” article in this issue , Is@@ aa@@ c was still gri@@ ev@@ ing over the lo@@ ss of his mother , S@@ ar@@ ah , three years after her death . ​ — Genesis 24 : 6@@ 7 .
For in@@ stance , you may find that some will ad@@ vi@@ se you not to c@@ ry or show your feelings in any way .
O@@ thers may p@@ us@@ h you to do the op@@ posit@@ e and ex@@ pose all your feelings .
The Bible presen@@ ts a more bal@@ an@@ ced view , one that is supp@@ or@@ ted by moder@@ n resear@@ ch .
In some cul@@ tures it is consi@@ dered un@@ man@@ ly for a male to c@@ ry .
But is there a real need to feel as@@ ha@@ med about she@@ dding te@@ ars , even in public ?
M@@ ent@@ al - health ex@@ per@@ ts ac@@ knowledge that te@@ ar@@ ful@@ ness is a nor@@ mal part of gri@@ ev@@ ing .
And gri@@ ev@@ ing may , in time , help you to move on desp@@ ite the en@@ or@@ m@@ ity of your lo@@ ss .
S@@ up@@ pre@@ ssing gri@@ ef , however , may do more har@@ m than good .
The Bible len@@ ds no support to the no@@ tion that it is wrong or un@@ man@@ ly to shed te@@ ars of gri@@ ef .
At the death of his de@@ ar friend La@@ z@@ ar@@ us , Jesus open@@ ly we@@ pt , even though he had the power to bring the dead back to life ! ​ — John 11 : 33 - 35 .
B@@ ou@@ ts of an@@ ger are often part of gri@@ ev@@ ing , especially in c@@ ases of su@@ d@@ den , u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted death .
There are many reas@@ ons why a ber@@ e@@ a@@ ved person may feel an@@ gr@@ y , such as when th@@ ough@@ t@@ less and un@@ f@@ oun@@ ded com@@ ments are made by a respe@@ cted person .
“ I was only 14 years old when my father died , ” explains a S@@ outh Afri@@ can man named Mi@@ ke .
“ At the fun@@ er@@ al , the An@@ g@@ li@@ can mini@@ ster said that God needs good people and ta@@ kes them early .
* This an@@ ger@@ ed me because we desp@@ er@@ ately needed our father .
E@@ spe@@ cially in the case of u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted death , the ber@@ e@@ a@@ ved person may re@@ pe@@ ate@@ dly think , ‘ It might not have happ@@ ened if only I had done this or that . ’
If you are being pla@@ gu@@ ed by such feelings of gu@@ il@@ t and an@@ ger , it is important not to bo@@ ttle up these emo@@ tions .
Rather , speak to a friend who will list@@ en and reas@@ sure you that such ir@@ r@@ ational feelings are common to many ber@@ e@@ a@@ ved ones .
The Bible re@@ min@@ ds us : “ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of di@@ stre@@ ss . ” ​ — Proverbs 17 : 17 .
The best F@@ ri@@ end a ber@@ e@@ a@@ ved person can have is our Creator , Jehovah God .
P@@ our out your heart to him in prayer because “ he ca@@ res for you . ”
Mor@@ e@@ over , he promi@@ ses that all who do so will have their th@@ ough@@ ts and feelings s@@ oo@@ th@@ ed by “ the peace of God that sur@@ pas@@ ses all understanding . ”
Al@@ so , al@@ low God to help you he@@ al by means of his con@@ so@@ ling Word , the Bible .
Ha@@ ving such th@@ ough@@ ts to p@@ onder over may be especially help@@ ful at night when you are alone and find it hard to sle@@ ep . ​ — Isaiah 5@@ 7 : 15 .
Re@@ cent@@ ly , a 40 - year - old man , whom we will call J@@ ack , lost his belo@@ ved wife to can@@ c@@ er .
“ When I pray to Jehovah , ” he explains , “ I never feel alone .
I often wake up during the night and cannot get back to sle@@ ep .
After reading and medi@@ t@@ ating on com@@ for@@ ting th@@ ough@@ ts from the Scriptures and then p@@ our@@ ing out the feelings of my heart in prayer , I sense a cal@@ m@@ ness and a tr@@ an@@ sc@@ en@@ ding peace come over me , pu@@ tting my mind and heart at rest and en@@ ab@@ ling me to sle@@ ep . ”
A young woman named Van@@ ess@@ a lost her mother to ill@@ ness .
She too has experi@@ enced the power of prayer .
“ In my most difficult times , ” she says , “ I would just call on God@@ ’@@ s name and bre@@ ak down in te@@ ars .
Jehovah list@@ ened to my pray@@ ers and always gave me the streng@@ th I needed . ”
Some ber@@ e@@ a@@ ve@@ ment coun@@ sel@@ ors ad@@ vi@@ se those who are stru@@ g@@ g@@ ling with gri@@ ef to get involved in help@@ ing others or to vol@@ un@@ teer their time in some comm@@ unity service .
Do@@ ing so can bring joy and may e@@ ase a person@@ ’@@ s gri@@ ef .
Many ber@@ e@@ a@@ ved Christians have found that working to help others has brought them great com@@ fort . ​ — 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 .
God fe@@ els for you in your pain . ​ — Psalm 5@@ 5 : 22 ; 1 Peter 5 : 7 .
God pati@@ ently list@@ ens to the pray@@ ers of his servants . ​ — Psalm 8@@ 6 : 5 ; 1 The@@ ss@@ al@@ oni@@ ans 5 : 17 .
God mis@@ ses people who have died . ​ — Job 14 : 13 - 15 .
God promi@@ ses to resur@@ re@@ ct the dead . ​ — Isaiah 26 : 19 ; John 5 : 28 , 29 .
Ha@@ ve you ever felt hel@@ ple@@ ss when someone near to you was gri@@ ev@@ ing over the lo@@ ss of a loved one ?
S@@ ome@@ times we may feel un@@ sure of what to say or do ​ — so we w@@ ind up saying and doing nothing .
But there are prac@@ tical , help@@ ful things that we can do .
O@@ f@@ ten , all that is needed is your pres@@ ence along with a simp@@ le expre@@ ssion , such as “ I am so sor@@ ry . ”
In many cul@@ tures , giving the person a hu@@ g or a gen@@ t@@ le s@@ qu@@ ee@@ ze of the arm is an effe@@ ctive way to show you care .
If the ber@@ e@@ a@@ ved one wan@@ ts to talk , list@@ en sy@@ mp@@ a@@ the@@ tic@@ ally .
B@@ est of all , do something for the ber@@ e@@ a@@ ved family , perhaps per@@ form@@ ing a ch@@ ore the gri@@ ev@@ ing one has not been able to care for , such as c@@ oo@@ king a me@@ al , c@@ aring for the children , or help@@ ing with fun@@ er@@ al arran@@ ge@@ ments if that is desi@@ red .
Such ac@@ tions may speak l@@ ou@@ der than the most el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent words .
In time , you may be moved to talk about the de@@ ce@@ as@@ ed , perhaps fo@@ c@@ using on some good quali@@ ties or happy experi@@ ences .
Such con@@ vers@@ ation may even bring a s@@ mi@@ le to the ber@@ e@@ a@@ ved person@@ ’@@ s face .
For example , Pa@@ m ​ — who lost her husband , I@@ an , si@@ x years ago — ​ says : “ People some@@ times tell me good things that I@@ an did that I never knew about , and that makes my heart feel good . ”
R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers report that many ber@@ e@@ a@@ ved people receive a lot of in@@ iti@@ al help but that their needs are soon for@@ go@@ t@@ ten as friends get bu@@ sy again with their own lives .
T@@ her@@ efore , make a point of cont@@ ac@@ ting a ber@@ e@@ a@@ ved friend on a reg@@ ular bas@@ is after the lo@@ ss .
* Many gri@@ ev@@ ing ones de@@ ep@@ ly appreci@@ ate this opport@@ unity to re@@ lie@@ ve themselves of pro@@ lon@@ ged feelings of gri@@ ef .
Consider the example of K@@ a@@ or@@ i , a young Jap@@ an@@ ese woman who was de@@ va@@ stated by the lo@@ ss of her mother follow@@ ed by the lo@@ ss of her older si@@ ster 15 months later .
T@@ han@@ k@@ fully , she received on@@ going support from loy@@ al friends .
One named R@@ it@@ su@@ k@@ o is much older than K@@ a@@ or@@ i and offer@@ ed to be her close friend .
“ To be hon@@ est , ” says K@@ a@@ or@@ i , “ I was@@ n@@ ’@@ t happy about that .
I di@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t want anyone to take the place of my mother , and I di@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t think that anyone could .
However , because of the way M@@ am@@ a R@@ it@@ su@@ k@@ o tre@@ ated me , I came to feel close to her .
E@@ very week , we went out in the ev@@ ange@@ li@@ zing work together and went to Christian meetings together .
She inv@@ ited me to have te@@ a with her , brought me me@@ als , and wrote me let@@ ters and car@@ ds many times .
M@@ am@@ a R@@ it@@ su@@ ko@@ ’@@ s posit@@ ive attitude had a good influ@@ ence on me . ”
T@@ wel@@ ve years have pas@@ sed since K@@ a@@ ori@@ ’@@ s mother died , and today she and her husband are full - time ev@@ ange@@ li@@ z@@ ers .
“ M@@ am@@ a R@@ it@@ su@@ k@@ o , ” K@@ a@@ or@@ i says , “ continu@@ es to show her concer@@ n .
When I go back home , I always visit her and enjoy her up@@ building associ@@ ation . ”
Ano@@ ther example of someone who benef@@ ited from on@@ going support is P@@ ol@@ i , one of Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses in C@@ y@@ pr@@ us .
P@@ ol@@ i had a kind husband , So@@ z@@ os , who set a good example as a Christian she@@ p@@ her@@ d by often inv@@ iting or@@ ph@@ ans and wi@@ do@@ ws to their home for associ@@ ation and a me@@ al .
S@@ ad@@ ly , at the age of 5@@ 3 , So@@ z@@ os died of a b@@ rain tu@@ m@@ or .
There , they began associ@@ ating with a congregation of Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
“ The friends in my new congregation , ” rec@@ alls P@@ ol@@ i , “ did not know anything about our past and our difficult circum@@ stances .
But that did not stop them from appro@@ aching us and emb@@ ra@@ cing us with their kind words and prac@@ tical help .
How preci@@ ous that help was , especially at that time , when my son needed his father most !
Those taking the lead in the congregation showed a great de@@ al of personal interest in Daniel .
One in partic@@ ular made sure to inclu@@ de Daniel when enjo@@ ying associ@@ ation with friends or when going out to pla@@ y b@@ all . ”
Bo@@ th mother and son are doing well today .
To be sure , there are many ways we can offer prac@@ tical help and com@@ fort to those who m@@ our@@ n .
The Bible also com@@ forts us by means of a th@@ ri@@ l@@ ling hope for the future .
Some have even mar@@ ked the d@@ ate of the death on their cal@@ en@@ da@@ r as a re@@ minder to offer com@@ fort when it may be most needed ​ — on or near the d@@ ate of the lo@@ ss .
You may rec@@ all that G@@ a@@ il , mentioned ear@@ li@@ er in this ser@@ ies , doub@@ ts whether she will ever get over the death of her husband , Ro@@ b .
However , she is loo@@ king for@@ ward to see@@ ing him again in God@@ ’@@ s promi@@ sed new world .
My feelings really go out to people who have lost someone they love but who are not a@@ ware of this hope of see@@ ing their loved one again . ”
S@@ oon , God will do just that ​ — for Job and coun@@ t@@ less others — ​ when this earth is trans@@ form@@ ed into a par@@ adise .
“ There is going to be a resurrec@@ tion , ” the Bible con@@ fir@@ ms at Acts 24 : 15 .
“ Do not be am@@ a@@ zed at this , ” Jesus as@@ su@@ res us , “ for the h@@ our is coming in which all those in the me@@ mor@@ ial t@@ om@@ bs will he@@ ar his vo@@ ice and come out . ”
He will have the pro@@ spe@@ ct of reg@@ a@@ ining “ his y@@ ou@@ th@@ ful vi@@ g@@ or , ” and his fle@@ sh will for@@ ever remain “ fre@@ s@@ her than in y@@ outh . ”
The same will happ@@ en to all who resp@@ ond with appreci@@ ation to God@@ ’@@ s mer@@ ci@@ ful provi@@ sion of a resurrec@@ tion to life on earth .
If you have suffer@@ ed the lo@@ ss of someone de@@ ar to you , the information we have discus@@ sed may not comple@@ tel@@ y take away your gri@@ ef .
But by medi@@ t@@ ating on God@@ ’@@ s promi@@ ses found in the Bible , you can find real hope and the streng@@ th to keep going . ​ — 1 The@@ ss@@ al@@ oni@@ ans 4 : 13 .
W@@ ould you like to learn more about how to cop@@ e with gri@@ ef ?
O@@ r do you have rel@@ ated questions , such as “ Why does God al@@ low evi@@ l and suffering ? ”

In the sp@@ ring of 33 C.@@ E . , Jesus the Na@@ z@@ ar@@ ene was ex@@ e@@ cu@@ ted .
He had been fal@@ sely char@@ ged with se@@ dition , sa@@ va@@ ge@@ ly be@@ at@@ en , and na@@ iled to a sta@@ ke .
But God rais@@ ed him back to life , and 40 days later , Jesus as@@ c@@ en@@ ded to heaven .
This ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ary account comes to us from the four Go@@ sp@@ els of the Christian Greek Scriptures , com@@ mon@@ ly called the New T@@ est@@ ament .
On the other hand , if those ev@@ ents really did happ@@ en , then there is a b@@ right future for mankind , one in which you can share .
So , are the Go@@ spel acc@@ oun@@ ts fact or fi@@ ction ?
Un@@ like f@@ an@@ ci@@ ful le@@ gen@@ ds , the Go@@ spel writ@@ ings refle@@ ct pa@@ in@@ sta@@ king acc@@ u@@ ra@@ cy and attention to de@@ ta@@ il .
For example , they ab@@ ound with n@@ ames of real plac@@ es , many of which can be visit@@ ed today .
They tell about real people , who@@ se exi@@ st@@ ence has been cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ated by se@@ cul@@ ar hi@@ stor@@ ians . ​ — Luke 3 : 1 , 2 , 23 .
Jesus himself is mentioned by se@@ cul@@ ar writ@@ ers of the first and second cent@@ uri@@ es .
* His man@@ ner of death , as descri@@ bed in the Go@@ sp@@ els , ag@@ re@@ es with Roman ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tional me@@ tho@@ ds of the time .
Mor@@ e@@ over , ev@@ ents are rel@@ ated in a fac@@ tu@@ al and can@@ did man@@ ner ​ — even por@@ tra@@ ying some of Jesus ’ disciples un@@ fa@@ vor@@ ab@@ ly .
All these fac@@ tors str@@ ong@@ ly indi@@ cate that the Go@@ spel writ@@ ers were hon@@ est and acc@@ ur@@ ate in what they wrote about Jesus .
While it is gener@@ ally accep@@ ted that Jesus lived and died , some would question his resurrec@@ tion .
Even his apost@@ les did not believe the in@@ iti@@ al report of his having re@@ turned to life .
All doub@@ t was re@@ moved , however , when they and other disciples saw the resurrec@@ ted Jesus on se@@ par@@ ate occa@@ sions .
In fact , in one case , there were more than 500 ey@@ ew@@ itnes@@ ses present . ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 6 .
At the ri@@ s@@ k of being ar@@ re@@ sted and kill@@ ed , the disciples coura@@ ge@@ ously pro@@ claim@@ ed Jesus ’ resurrec@@ tion to all ​ — even to the very ones who had ex@@ e@@ cu@@ ted him .
W@@ ould so many disciples have been so bo@@ ld if they were not ab@@ solu@@ tel@@ y sure that Jesus had really been resurrec@@ ted ?
In fact , the re@@ ality of the resurrec@@ tion of Jesus is the dri@@ ving for@@ ce beh@@ ind the imp@@ act that Christi@@ an@@ ity has had on the world both then and now .
The Go@@ spel acc@@ oun@@ ts of Jesus ’ death and resurrec@@ tion be@@ ar all the necess@@ ary mar@@ ks of an au@@ th@@ enti@@ c hi@@ stor@@ ical rec@@ ord .
Ca@@ re@@ fully reading them will con@@ vin@@ ce you that these ev@@ ents really happ@@ ened .
Your con@@ vi@@ ction can be further streng@@ th@@ ened when you understand why they took place .
T@@ ac@@ it@@ us , born about 5@@ 5 C.@@ E . , wrote that “ Christus , from whom the name [ Christians ] had its orig@@ in , suffer@@ ed the ex@@ tre@@ me pen@@ al@@ ty during the re@@ ig@@ n of Ti@@ ber@@ i@@ us at the hands of one of our pro@@ cur@@ at@@ ors , P@@ on@@ ti@@ us P@@ il@@ at@@ us . ”
Jesus is also refer@@ red to by Su@@ et@@ oni@@ us ( first century ) ; Jewish hi@@ stor@@ i@@ an Jose@@ ph@@ us ( first century ) ; and P@@ lin@@ y the Y@@ oun@@ ger , govern@@ or of Bi@@ th@@ y@@ ni@@ a ( early second century ) .
Then , too , it is un@@ likely that Jesus ’ many op@@ po@@ sers would writ@@ e anything that would l@@ end cre@@ di@@ bility to the reports about him .
R@@ eg@@ arding Jesus ’ resurrec@@ tion , Peter , one of his apost@@ les , explained : “ God rais@@ ed this one up on the thir@@ d day and al@@ low@@ ed him to become mani@@ f@@ est , not to all the people , but to witnes@@ ses ap@@ pointed be@@ fore@@ hand by God , to us , who ate and dr@@ an@@ k with him after his ri@@ sing from the dead . ”
Matthe@@ w@@ ’@@ s Go@@ spel tel@@ ls us that when the religious en@@ emi@@ es heard reports of Jesus ’ resurrec@@ tion , they sc@@ he@@ med to su@@ p@@ pre@@ ss them . ​ — Matthew 28 : 11 - 15 .
Does this mean that Jesus wanted his resurrec@@ tion to be kept se@@ cre@@ t ?
No , for Peter went on to say : “ He or@@ dered us to pre@@ ach to the people and to give a thor@@ ough witnes@@ s that this is the one de@@ cre@@ ed by God to be ju@@ dge of the living and the dead . ”
Tru@@ e Christians have done and are doing just that . ​ — Acts 10 : 42 .
“ Th@@ r@@ ough one man [ Adam ] sin enter@@ ed into the world and death through sin . ” ​ — Romans 5 : 12
What would you say if you were asked , “ Do you want to live for@@ ever ? ”
Most people would pro@@ bab@@ ly say that they want to but that they feel it is un@@ reali@@ stic to consider it .
De@@ ath is a nor@@ mal part of life , they say , the natural out@@ come of our exi@@ st@@ ence .
S@@ up@@ pose , though , that the question were turned around and you were asked , “ Are you ready to die ? ”
Un@@ der nor@@ mal circum@@ stances , most people would answer no .
The Bible shows that God cre@@ ated humans with the desire and the will to live .
In fact , it says that “ he has even put e@@ tern@@ ity in their heart . ” ​ — Ecc@@ le@@ sia@@ stes 3 : 11 .
The re@@ ality , though , is that humans do not live for@@ ever .
F@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , has God done anything to re@@ me@@ dy the situation ?
The Bi@@ ble@@ ’@@ s ans@@ wers are hear@@ ten@@ ing , and they have a di@@ re@@ ct be@@ aring on why Jesus suffer@@ ed and died .
The first three chap@@ ters of the Bible book of Genesis tell us that God set before the first human cou@@ p@@ le , Adam and E@@ ve , the pro@@ spe@@ ct of un@@ en@@ ding life and told them what they would have to do to ga@@ in it .
Then the account descri@@ bes how they fa@@ iled to obe@@ y God and lost that pro@@ spe@@ ct .
The story is told simply ​ — so simply that some are qui@@ ck to dis@@ mi@@ ss it as fol@@ kl@@ ore .
But Genesis , like the Go@@ sp@@ els , gives every indi@@ cation of being a fac@@ tu@@ al , hi@@ stor@@ ical rec@@ ord .
What has been the result of A@@ dam@@ ’@@ s fa@@ il@@ ure to obe@@ y ?
The Bible ans@@ wers this way : “ Th@@ r@@ ough one man [ Adam ] sin enter@@ ed into the world and death through sin , and so death spre@@ ad to all men because they had all sin@@ ned . ”
He thus lost the pro@@ spe@@ ct of end@@ less life and ev@@ ent@@ ually died .
Be@@ ing his de@@ sc@@ en@@ dan@@ ts , we have in@@ her@@ ited his sin@@ ful con@@ dition .
But has God done anything to re@@ me@@ dy the situation ?
Yes , God made arran@@ ge@@ ments to re@@ de@@ em , or bu@@ y back , what Adam had lost for his de@@ sc@@ en@@ dan@@ ts , nam@@ ely , the pro@@ spe@@ ct of end@@ less life .
“ The wa@@ ges sin pa@@ ys is death , ” says the Bible at Romans 6 : 23 .
This means that death is the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of sin .
Li@@ ke@@ wise , we sin and are therefore sub@@ ject to sin@@ ’@@ s wa@@ ges , death .
But we were born in this sin@@ ful con@@ dition through no fa@@ ul@@ t of our own .
So God lo@@ v@@ ingly sent his Son , Jesus , to accep@@ t ‘ the wa@@ ges of sin ’ for us .
Jesus ’ death op@@ ens the way to a happy , end@@ less life
Since one man , the perfect man Adam , brought sin and death on us through di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ence , a perfect man obe@@ di@@ ent even ti@@ ll death was needed to re@@ lea@@ se us from that bur@@ den .
The Bible explains it this way : “ Ju@@ st as through the di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ence of the one man many were made sin@@ ners , so also through the obe@@ di@@ ence of the one person many will be made righteous . ”
He left heaven , became a perfect man * , and died in our be@@ half .
As a result , it is possible for us to have a righteous standing with God and ga@@ in the pro@@ spe@@ ct of end@@ less life .
Why , though , was it necess@@ ary for Jesus to die to accomp@@ lish this ?
C@@ ould not Al@@ mi@@ gh@@ ty God have simply issu@@ ed a de@@ cre@@ e that A@@ dam@@ ’@@ s de@@ sc@@ en@@ dan@@ ts be al@@ low@@ ed to live for@@ ever ?
H@@ ad God set justi@@ ce a@@ side in this in@@ stance , people might have wonder@@ ed whether he would do so in other matters as well .
For example , would he be fa@@ ir in determin@@ ing who among A@@ dam@@ ’@@ s off@@ sp@@ ring quali@@ fy for e@@ tern@@ al life ?
C@@ ould he be tru@@ sted to keep his promi@@ ses ?
God@@ ’@@ s ad@@ her@@ ence to justi@@ ce in working out our sal@@ vation is as@@ sur@@ ance to us that he will always do what is right .
By Jesus ’ sacrifi@@ cial death , God open@@ ed the way to end@@ less life in Par@@ adise on earth .
No@@ te Jesus ’ words as recor@@ ded at John 3 : 16 : “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - be@@ go@@ t@@ ten Son , so that every@@ one exerci@@ sing faith in him might not be destro@@ yed but have everlasting life . ”
Jesus ’ death is thus an expre@@ ssion not only of God@@ ’@@ s un@@ fa@@ il@@ ing justi@@ ce but , more spe@@ cially , of his great love for humans .
However , why did Jesus have to su@@ ffer and die in the pa@@ in@@ ful way that was descri@@ bed in the Go@@ sp@@ els ?
By sub@@ je@@ cting himself to the ex@@ tre@@ me t@@ est and rema@@ ining faithful , Jesus re@@ fu@@ ted once and for all the D@@ ev@@ il@@ ’@@ s cla@@ im that humans would not remain loy@@ al to God when under tri@@ al .
That cla@@ im might have se@@ em@@ ed va@@ lid after Satan in@@ du@@ ced perfect Adam to sin .
But Jesus ​ — who was A@@ dam@@ ’@@ s perfect e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent — ​ rema@@ ined obe@@ di@@ ent desp@@ ite se@@ ver@@ e suffering .
He thus proved that Adam too could have obe@@ yed God if he had cho@@ sen to do so .
By en@@ during under tri@@ al , Jesus left us a mo@@ del to follow .
God re@@ war@@ ded his S@@ on@@ ’@@ s perfect obe@@ di@@ ence , gr@@ an@@ ting Jesus im@@ mor@@ tal life in heaven .
Jesus indi@@ cated what we need to do when he said : “ This means everlasting life , their coming to know you , the only true God , and the one whom you sent , Jesus Christ . ” ​ — John 17 : 3 .

We went to the ter@@ rit@@ ory , and he gave me some boo@@ kle@@ ts about God@@ ’@@ s Kingdom .
One of the si@@ sters there gave us children Bible less@@ ons based on the Bible and the book The Har@@ p of God .
As a teen@@ a@@ ger , I enjo@@ yed giving people hope from God@@ ’@@ s Word .

Y@@ ear@@ s later , his pati@@ ence was re@@ war@@ ded when his wife was baptized as one of Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
After the war , I pion@@ eer@@ ed for two years in sou@@ ther@@ n I@@ re@@ land .
We did not reali@@ ze how much power the pri@@ ests had .

I often feel that these artic@@ les are written just for me .

He wrote : “ E@@ very house is con@@ stru@@ cted by someone , but the one who con@@ stru@@ cted all things is God . ”
Why is it so important to know your children well ?

This has done won@@ ders for her faith in God and in the Bible . ”
The first article shows how our faith can gro@@ w and remain strong .
Let me expla@@ in what led to that con@@ vers@@ ation .
I WA@@ S born in W@@ i@@ ch@@ it@@ a , K@@ ans@@ as , U.S@@ .@@ A . , on De@@ ce@@ mber 10 , 19@@ 36 , the ol@@ de@@ st of four children .
Then a sol@@ di@@ er wal@@ ked by , and the doc@@ tor y@@ el@@ led , “ Do something about this y@@ el@@ low co@@ ward ! ”
The sol@@ di@@ er could see that the man was dr@@ un@@ k , so he told him , “ G@@ o home and so@@ ber up ! ”
He o@@ w@@ ned two bar@@ ber@@ sho@@ ps in W@@ i@@ ch@@ it@@ a , and the doc@@ tor was one of his c@@ li@@ ents !
With my parents , going to a conven@@ tion in W@@ i@@ ch@@ it@@ a in the 19@@ 40 ’ s
With Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s ble@@ ssing and their ze@@ al@@ ous work , a congregation was started .
The brother also so@@ ld my c@@ ar for $ 25 .
We were assig@@ ned to special pioneer in W@@ al@@ n@@ ut Ri@@ dge , Ar@@ k@@ ans@@ as .
Then in 19@@ 6@@ 2 , we were th@@ ri@@ l@@ led to receive an inv@@ it@@ ation to the 3@@ 7@@ th cl@@ ass of Gi@@ lead .
In the ministry in Na@@ i@@ ro@@ b@@ i with M@@ ary and Ch@@ r@@ is Kan@@ a@@ i@@ y@@ a
S@@ oon after , our first daugh@@ ter , K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly , was born , and 17 months later , we had S@@ te@@ p@@ han@@ y .
We would also go c@@ amp@@ ing with them and would have very enjo@@ y@@ able con@@ vers@@ ations around the c@@ amp@@ fi@@ re .
We arran@@ ged to have some who were in the full - time ministry sta@@ y in our home .
They were sho@@ cked and started to c@@ ry and said that they wanted to study .
With the help and direc@@ tion of God@@ ’@@ s organization , we did our best to ra@@ ise them to love Jehovah .
On a later tri@@ p , K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly met one of his wor@@ k@@ m@@ ates , B@@ ri@@ an L@@ le@@ wel@@ l@@ yn .
So they did sta@@ y free until they were at le@@ ast 23 .
At the same time , B@@ ri@@ an and K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly were inv@@ ited to work at L@@ ond@@ on Bethel and later were trans@@ fer@@ red to Mal@@ a@@ w@@ i Bethel .
The day after we left for the Watchtower E@@ du@@ c@@ ational C@@ enter in P@@ at@@ ter@@ son , L@@ in@@ da called to tell us that M@@ other had died .
N@@ ex@@ t , we taught the course in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we and then in Z@@ am@@ bi@@ a .

We must recogni@@ ze that when we pre@@ pare for the ministry , for the meetings , or for a talk , we may not necess@@ ar@@ ily app@@ ly what we read to ourselves .
Since my mind is main@@ ly involved in an in@@ tel@@ le@@ c@@ tu@@ al exerci@@ se , my heart is not necess@@ ar@@ ily tou@@ ched by the spiritual th@@ ough@@ ts I am reading .

In what ways must we exerci@@ se our faith ?
In what two ways does Hebrews 11 : 1 descri@@ be faith ?

For example , John explained : “ The one who exerci@@ ses faith in the Son has everlasting life ; the one who di@@ so@@ be@@ ys the Son will not see life , but the w@@ r@@ ath of God rema@@ ins upon him . ”
Com@@ pared with love , how important is faith ?
James asked his anointed brothers : “ D@@ id not God ch@@ oo@@ se those who are p@@ oor from the world@@ ’@@ s stand@@ point to be ri@@ ch in faith and hei@@ rs of the Kingdom , which he promi@@ sed to those who love him ? ”

What hope did Jehovah give his people , and why was this promise re@@ mar@@ k@@ able ?

( Read 1 Peter 2 : 9 , 10 . )
( Read Matthew 13 : 24 , 25 , 37 - 39 . )

When we are an@@ x@@ ious , why is prayer so important ?
( Read Matthew 11 : 28 - 30 . )
What did Jesus mean when he said : “ Ne@@ ver be an@@ x@@ ious ” ?
He ad@@ mit@@ ted : “ My ang@@ ui@@ shed heart makes me gro@@ an al@@ oud . ”
( See the bo@@ x “ Some P@@ ra@@ c@@ tical W@@ a@@ ys to Re@@ du@@ ce An@@ x@@ iety . ” )

How , though , does the hope of a re@@ ward benefit us ?
Jesus showed that his disciples would be re@@ war@@ ded for their sacrifi@@ ces ( See par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph 5 )
The apostle Peter once asked Jesus : “ We have left all things and follow@@ ed you ; what , then , will there be for us ? ”
In the Ser@@ m@@ on on the M@@ ount , Jesus said : “ Re@@ jo@@ ice and be over@@ jo@@ yed , since your re@@ ward is great in the heav@@ ens , for in that way they perse@@ cu@@ ted the prophe@@ ts pri@@ or to you . ”
Moses told the nation of Israel : “ Jehovah will su@@ rely ble@@ ss you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to po@@ ss@@ ess as an in@@ her@@ it@@ ance , but only if you stri@@ c@@ tly obe@@ y the vo@@ ice of Jehovah your God and care@@ fully ob@@ serve all this comman@@ d@@ ment that I am giving you today .
For Jehovah your God will ble@@ ss you just as he has promi@@ sed you . ”
And he named the second one E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , for he said , ‘ God has made me fru@@ it@@ ful in the land of my af@@ f@@ li@@ ction . ’ ”
God@@ ’@@ s Word explains : “ For the joy that was set before him he en@@ du@@ red a tor@@ ture sta@@ ke , desp@@ is@@ ing sha@@ me . ”
Jesus certainly found joy in being able to s@@ an@@ cti@@ fy God@@ ’@@ s name .
How does Jehovah feel about what we do for him ?
“ The one sho@@ wing fa@@ v@@ or to the low@@ ly is len@@ ding to Jehovah , and He will re@@ pa@@ y him for what he does . ”
What com@@ fort do we find at 1 John 3 : 19 , 20 ?
( Read 1 John 3 : 19 , 20 . )
What are some of the re@@ war@@ ds that we enjoy now ?
How do Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s servants feel about the re@@ war@@ ds they receive ?
For example , Bi@@ an@@ ca from Ger@@ many says : “ I cannot than@@ k Jehovah enough for help@@ ing me with my wor@@ ri@@ es and for being at my side each day .
The world out there is cha@@ o@@ tic and ble@@ ak .
But as I work clo@@ sely with Jehovah , I feel se@@ c@@ ure in his ar@@ ms .
Wh@@ en@@ ever I make personal sacrifi@@ ces for him , he gives me back a hundre@@ d@@ f@@ old in ble@@ ss@@ ings . ”
For my own encoura@@ gement , I keep a no@@ te@@ book with scri@@ p@@ tures and th@@ ough@@ ts from our publi@@ cations that I can con@@ sul@@ t from time to time .
I call it ‘ My S@@ ur@@ vi@@ val No@@ te@@ book . ’
D@@ is@@ coura@@ gement is temp@@ or@@ ary if we fo@@ c@@ us on Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s promi@@ ses .
Jehovah is always there to help us , reg@@ ar@@ d@@ less of our circum@@ stances . ”
Yet , you can likely think of ways in which Jehovah has re@@ war@@ ded you and those around you .

Par@@ ents , if that descri@@ bes your children , can you learn at le@@ ast some of the local language ?
A child who commun@@ ic@@ ates best in another spo@@ ken language de@@ ser@@ ves the same concer@@ n , would you not ag@@ ree ?
“ But when we saw her stu@@ d@@ ying , pra@@ ying , and doing her best to conduct family worship every week , we under@@ st@@ ood that get@@ ting to know Jehovah was very important . ”
How can parents help children who may need to study in two langu@@ ages ?
( a ) Who must deci@@ de which language congregation to att@@ end ?
That may not be the case when children do not fully understand the language .
( Read 1 Corinthians 14 : 9 , 11 . )
The answer was not what we person@@ ally found conven@@ i@@ ent .
But when we saw that they were get@@ ting little benefit from the meetings in our language , we deci@@ ded to move to the local - language congregation .
To@@ gether , we reg@@ ularly atten@@ ded meetings and sha@@ red in the ministry .
We also inv@@ ited local friends to jo@@ in us for me@@ als and exc@@ ur@@ sions .
All of this helped our children to get to know the brothers and to get to know Jehovah , not only as their God but also as their Father and F@@ ri@@ end .
We consi@@ dered this to be much more important than their ma@@ ster@@ ing our language . ”
Samuel ad@@ ds : “ To keep ourselves spirit@@ ually strong , my wife and I also atten@@ ded meetings in our language .
Life was very bu@@ sy , and we were ti@@ red .
But we than@@ k Jehovah for ble@@ ssing our ef@@ forts and sacrifi@@ ces .
Our three children are all serving Jehovah in the full - time ministry . ”
“ I knew the ba@@ si@@ cs of my parents ’ language , but the language spo@@ ken at the meetings was over my head , ” rec@@ alls K@@ ri@@ st@@ ina .
“ When I was 12 , I atten@@ ded a conven@@ tion in my school language .
For the first time , I under@@ st@@ ood that what I was hear@@ ing was the truth !
Ano@@ ther tur@@ ning point came when I began to pray in my school language .
I could speak to Jehovah from my heart ! ”
Y@@ oun@@ g people , do you think that you would pre@@ f@@ er being part of a local - language congregation ?
“ When my si@@ bl@@ ings and I got into our te@@ ens , we wanted to s@@ wit@@ ch to the local - language congregation , ” says Na@@ dia , who now ser@@ ves at Bethel .
“ Now we@@ ’@@ re gr@@ ate@@ ful that our parents wor@@ ked hard to teach us their language and kept us in the for@@ eig@@ n - language congregation .
It has en@@ ri@@ ched our lives and bro@@ ad@@ ened our opport@@ un@@ ities to help others get to know Jehovah . ”
( b ) How can parents get help in teaching their children the truth ?
( Read Proverbs 1 : 8 ; 31 : 10 , 27 , 28 . )
Sti@@ ll , parents who do not know the local language may need help to re@@ ach their chil@@ dr@@ en@@ ’@@ s heart .
Bo@@ th children and parents benefit from associ@@ ation with the congregation ( See par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s 18 , 19 )
( b ) What must parents continue to do ?
“ When they helped me with stu@@ dent talk assig@@ n@@ ments for the meet@@ ing , I always learned more .
And I enjo@@ yed the le@@ is@@ ure activ@@ ities we sha@@ red in as a group . ”
Par@@ ents , pray to Jehovah for help , and try your best .

She accep@@ ted a magazine sub@@ scri@@ p@@ tion and wanted me to me@@ et her husband , G@@ ary .
E@@ v@@ ent@@ ually , five from their cl@@ ass became Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
At that time , she gave me a p@@ ie@@ ce of can@@ dy and asked if we could be friends .
When she wanted to get baptized , her parents told her , “ Be@@ come one of Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , and you will have to leave our home ! ”
She continued her study and later got baptized .
When we got married in 19@@ 60 , her parents did not come to our we@@ dding .

On his last night on earth , Jesus said to his disciples : “ I am giving you a new comman@@ d@@ ment , that you love one another ; just as I have loved you , you also love one another .
By this all will know that you are my disciples ​ — if you have love among your@@ selves . ” ​ — John 13 : 34 , 35 .
The apostle John wrote : “ The one who does not love his brother , whom he has seen , cannot love God , whom he has not seen . ”

Why is it important that we clo@@ the ourselves with love ?

Jesus said : “ No one has love greater than this , that someone should sur@@ ren@@ der his life in be@@ half of his friends . ”
Let us consider how we can do so .

Then I continue with the point of my story .
Although the im@@ medi@@ ate point is not in itself about the Bible , often others are cu@@ ri@@ ous about what I do when teaching the Bible .
The more I use this appro@@ ach , the e@@ asi@@ er it ge@@ ts .
And af@@ ter@@ ward , I always feel great ! ”
We are the only Witnesses they are ex@@ posed to .
So the way we act can deter@@ m@@ ine how they will resp@@ ond .
What if we are s@@ hy or ti@@ m@@ id or have a hard time spea@@ king up about our faith , or what if we c@@ r@@ inge when we do speak up ?
Then they may look at us as if we ar@@ en@@ ’@@ t pr@@ oud of who we are .
They may even resp@@ ond un@@ kin@@ dly because of our l@@ ack of confi@@ dence .
However , if we talk with e@@ ase and as@@ sur@@ ance about what we believe , making it a nor@@ mal part of con@@ vers@@ ation , it@@ ’@@ s more likely that they will respect us . ”
Jesus said : “ If anyone wan@@ ts to come after me , let him di@@ so@@ wn himself and pic@@ k up his tor@@ ture sta@@ ke and keep following me . ”

What less@@ on can we learn from Isaiah 40 : 26 ?
No one has been able to coun@@ t all the st@@ ars in the uni@@ verse .
How can we be sure that Jehovah is able to streng@@ then us ?
And he ad@@ ded : “ You will find ref@@ re@@ sh@@ ment for your@@ selves .
For my y@@ o@@ ke is kin@@ dly , and my lo@@ ad is light . ”
But how do we feel when we return ?
The information was presen@@ ted in such an emp@@ a@@ the@@ tic and concer@@ ned way that I was moved to te@@ ars .
I was re@@ min@@ ded that the meetings are where I need to be . ”
What did the apostle Paul mean when he wrote : “ When I am we@@ ak , then I am power@@ ful ” ?
He s@@ ang : “ With your help I can char@@ ge against a mar@@ au@@ der band ; by God@@ ’@@ s power I can sc@@ ale a w@@ all . ”
O@@ r will we follow the Bi@@ ble@@ ’@@ s wise ad@@ vice to se@@ ttle matters qui@@ ck@@ ly ?
You might begin the con@@ vers@@ ation by saying something like this , “ Per@@ haps I am being over@@ ly sen@@ sit@@ ive , but when you spo@@ ke to me y@@ e@@ ster@@ day , I felt . . . ”
For day and night your hand was heav@@ y upon me . ”
“ Fin@@ ally I conf@@ es@@ sed my sin to you , ” he wrote , “ and you par@@ don@@ ed the er@@ ro@@ r of my sins . ”

( b ) What shows that Jehovah has ans@@ wer@@ ed Jesus ’ prayer ?
( Read John 17 : 20 , 21 . )
( Read Ez@@ ek@@ i@@ el 37 : 15 - 17 . )
How can we pro@@ mo@@ te unity among God@@ ’@@ s people ?
How can we show that we are “ pu@@ tting up with one another in love ” ?
How do we know that there will be a fin@@ al Me@@ mor@@ ial ?
At Ri@@ ber@@ al@@ t@@ a , B@@ en@@ i , two pioneer cou@@ ples lo@@ ad liter@@ ature on@@ to an a@@ ir@@ plan@@ e .
Why does Jehovah expe@@ ct us to use our valu@@ able things to give back to him ?
How does the organization use the money that is don@@ ated today ?
What do we show Jehovah when we support his work ?
( Read 2 Corinthians 8 : 18 - 21 . )
Your don@@ ations help our world@@ wide work ( See par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s 14 - 16 )
As a result , we some@@ times feel i@@ sol@@ ated , and we e@@ asi@@ ly for@@ get the sc@@ op@@ e of Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s work .
But as soon as we wat@@ ch the vari@@ ous pro@@ gra@@ ms on J@@ W Bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ sting , we re@@ member that we are part of an inter@@ national bro@@ ther@@ h@@ ood .
Our de@@ ar local brothers and si@@ sters are very exc@@ ited about J@@ W Bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ sting .
We often he@@ ar them say that after wat@@ ching the mon@@ th@@ ly pro@@ gra@@ ms , they feel close to the members of the Go@@ ver@@ ning Bo@@ dy .
Now they are pr@@ ou@@ der than ever to be part of God@@ ’@@ s organization . ”
( Read Proverbs 11 : 24 , 25 . )
A man who lo@@ ves his wife lo@@ ves himself , for no man ever h@@ ated his own body , but he fe@@ eds and ch@@ er@@ is@@ hes it . ”
How can we avoid be@@ coming lo@@ vers of ourselves ?
Paul wrote that people would be “ lo@@ vers of money . ”
Some years ago , a pioneer in I@@ re@@ land spo@@ ke to a man about God .
What does the Bible say about ri@@ ches and po@@ ver@@ ty ?
He wrote : “ So that I do not become satis@@ fied and den@@ y you and say , ‘ Who is Jehovah ? ’ ”
She would say , ‘ I have the great@@ est bo@@ ss ever ! ’
Now that I too am pion@@ eer@@ ing , we both work for the same Per@@ son , Jehovah . ”
How can we avoid be@@ coming lo@@ vers of money ?
It means that they do not love God at all . ”
How can we avoid be@@ coming lo@@ vers of pleas@@ ures ?
We also know that love “ does not b@@ rag , does not get pu@@ ff@@ ed up . ”
I could see that they ca@@ red for me , and that made me want to ple@@ ase them . ”
( Read John 13 : 34 , 35 . )
( Read Isaiah 11 : 6 , 7 . )
You can read some of their experi@@ ences in the ser@@ ies “ The Bible Ch@@ an@@ ges Li@@ ves , ” found on j@@ w@@ .@@ org .

( Read Mal@@ ach@@ i 3 : 17 , 18 . )
( b ) How did Jehovah view Daniel ?
( b ) What can parents today learn from Dani@@ el@@ ’@@ s parents ?

( Read Daniel 6 : 7 - 10 . )
( Read Job 31 : 24 - 28 . )
( Read Psalm 11 : 5 ; 26 : 4 . )
So ask yourself , ‘ Do I know Jehovah as well as No@@ ah , Daniel , and Job did ? ’
No@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s great - gr@@ and@@ father E@@ no@@ ch also “ kept wal@@ king with the true God . ”
Jesus said : “ Abraham your father re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed great@@ ly at the pro@@ spe@@ ct of see@@ ing my day . ”
I@@ t@@ ’@@ s hard for me to expre@@ ss the joy we feel . ”
For it is to us God has reve@@ aled them through his spirit . ”
Jesus said : “ These things I have spo@@ ken to you , so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be made full . ”
( 3 ) How will our ef@@ fort to have “ the mind of Christ ” help us to be spiritual people ?
( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 14 - 16 . )
What does the Bible say about spirit@@ ually - min@@ ded people ?
What can we learn from the example of J@@ ac@@ o@@ b ?
What can we learn from the example of M@@ ary ?
( Read Luke 1 : 46 - 5@@ 5 . )
( Read Isaiah 6@@ 3 : 9 ; Mark 6 : 34 . )
R@@ ac@@ he@@ l , a si@@ ster in Bra@@ z@@ il , says : “ I loved to follow the world@@ ’@@ s f@@ as@@ hi@@ ons .
As a result , I did not dre@@ ss very mo@@ de@@ st@@ ly .
But lear@@ ning the truth moved me to make the needed ef@@ fort to be a spiritual person .
Ma@@ king chan@@ ges was not e@@ asy , but I became happ@@ ier and found real purpose in life . ”
So being like Jesus makes us more like Jehovah .
They said : “ We are witnes@@ ses of all the things he did . ”
How will having the mind of Christ af@@ fect your da@@ ily life ?
He says : “ I never did anything wrong , but I was just going through the mo@@ tions .
I loo@@ ked spirit@@ ually strong , being at all the meetings and serving as an au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary pioneer a few times a year .
He says : “ It was as if I knew nothing .
I thought to myself , ‘ If I am going to be my wi@@ fe@@ ’@@ s spiritual head , I have to do something . ’ ”
He says : “ I stu@@ died the Bible and stu@@ died and stu@@ died some more , and the p@@ ie@@ ces started to f@@ it together .
I got understanding and , most important , develop@@ ed a close relationship with Jehovah . ”
( 3 ) How can strong spirit@@ u@@ ality help us in our da@@ ily life ?
( b ) What is our go@@ al when we study and medi@@ t@@ ate ?
( b ) What Bible example can we imit@@ ate ?
12 , 13 . ( a ) What will help us to app@@ ly Romans 15 : 5 ?

The apostle Peter ur@@ ged Christians in the first century : “ Be hospit@@ able to one another . ”
Ri@@ se , get baptized . ” ​ — A@@ C@@ T@@ S 22 : 16 .
What do Christian parents want to be sure of before their children get baptized ?
“ F@@ O@@ R months I kept tel@@ ling D@@ ad and M@@ om that I wanted to be baptized , and they often tal@@ ked to me about it .
On De@@ ce@@ mber 31 , 19@@ 34 , the day came for this m@@ om@@ ent@@ ous ev@@ ent in my life . ”
5 , 6 . ( a ) The Bi@@ ble@@ ’@@ s descri@@ p@@ tion of Timothy lea@@ ds us to what conclu@@ sion about his bapti@@ sm ?
( Read C@@ olo@@ ssi@@ ans 1 : 9 , 10 . )
He told Jehovah that he was so happy about his little gir@@ l@@ ’@@ s deci@@ sion to dedi@@ cate her life to Hi@@ m . ”
( Read 1 Peter 3 : 20 , 21 . )
Why do we not press@@ ure anyone to get baptized ?
If you are a par@@ ent , you may have asked yourself : ‘ Is my child really ready to get baptized ?
The first question is , “ On the bas@@ is of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ , have you re@@ pen@@ ted of your sins and dedi@@ cated yourself to Jehovah to do his will ? ”
How can we be hospit@@ able at our Christian meetings ?
( Read 3 John 5 - 8 . )
He writ@@ es : “ I he@@ sit@@ ated in@@ iti@@ ally because we were new@@ ly married and living in a small house .
But having studen@@ ts sta@@ y with us was truly a jo@@ y@@ ous experience .
As new@@ ly@@ we@@ ds , we were able to see how happy a cou@@ p@@ le can be when they serve Jehovah and pur@@ su@@ e spiritual go@@ als together . ”
Why may those who are new to your congregation need hospit@@ ality ?
One ev@@ ening my wife was partic@@ ularly ho@@ me@@ si@@ ck , and my ef@@ forts to help were not working .
Then , about 7 : 30 p@@ .@@ m . , we heard a kno@@ ck on the d@@ oor .
There st@@ ood a Bible stu@@ dent who brought us three or@@ an@@ ges .
She had come to wel@@ come the new mission@@ aries .
We inv@@ ited her in and gave her a gl@@ ass of water .
But as with anything in rel@@ ation to serving Jehovah , the benef@@ its and satis@@ fac@@ tion that result far ou@@ twe@@ i@@ gh any an@@ x@@ iety .
I have enjo@@ yed simply sit@@ ting down with gu@@ ests over co@@ f@@ fe@@ e and tal@@ king . ”
Ano@@ ther el@@ der writ@@ es : “ Ha@@ ving friends from the congregation to my home hel@@ ps me to understand them better and gives me time to get to know them , especially how they came into the truth . ”
The wife of one of the instru@@ c@@ tors really put me at e@@ ase .
She said that when she and her husband are serving in the travel@@ ing work , their best we@@ eks are those sp@@ ent sta@@ ying with a spiritual person who may not have much materi@@ ally but who has the same fo@@ c@@ us as they have ​ — serving Jehovah and ke@@ eping life simp@@ le .
This re@@ min@@ ded me of what my mu@@ m used to say to us as children : ‘ B@@ et@@ ter a dis@@ h of ve@@ get@@ ab@@ les where ther@@ e@@ ’@@ s love . ’ ”
( Read Proverbs 25 : 21 , 22 . )

So for the next few studies , we discus@@ sed scri@@ p@@ tures on pri@@ de and its effe@@ cts .
G@@ ra@@ ham began to see himself c@@ learly in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r of God@@ ’@@ s Word , and he did not like what he saw !
After ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging that he had been bl@@ in@@ ded by a ‘ ra@@ f@@ ter ’ of pri@@ de and that his c@@ rit@@ ical attitude was his problem , he began to change qui@@ ck@@ ly for the better .
He started to att@@ end Christian meetings reg@@ ularly , to study God@@ ’@@ s Word ear@@ ne@@ st@@ ly , and to make da@@ ily prayer a hab@@ it .
‘ I@@ ’@@ ve known the truth for years , ’ he said , ‘ and I@@ ’@@ ve even served as a pioneer .
The apostle Peter wrote : “ S@@ he@@ p@@ her@@ d the flo@@ ck of God under your care , serving as over@@ se@@ ers , not under comp@@ ul@@ sion , but will@@ ingly before God ; not for love of di@@ sh@@ on@@ est ga@@ in , but e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly ; not l@@ ording it over those who are God@@ ’@@ s in@@ her@@ it@@ ance , but be@@ coming exam@@ ples to the flo@@ ck . ”
How can parents ra@@ ise their children in the dis@@ ci@@ pline of Jehovah ?
( Read Hebrews 12 : 5 - 11 . )
How does a child devel@@ op self - dis@@ ci@@ pline ?
4 , 5 . ( a ) Why is self - dis@@ ci@@ pline an important part of “ the new person@@ ality ” ?
How can we become better studen@@ ts of God@@ ’@@ s Word ?
( b ) How did one family benefit from the parents ’ obe@@ di@@ ence to Jehovah ?
Some years later , the daugh@@ ter was re@@ in@@ stated .
( b ) How can we make the elders ’ work more pleas@@ ant for them ?
They did not ber@@ ate me or c@@ rit@@ i@@ ci@@ ze me , but they encoura@@ ged me and streng@@ th@@ ened me .
After every congregation meet@@ ing , no matter how bu@@ sy they were , at le@@ ast one of them would ask how I was .
Because of my past , I found it difficult to feel wor@@ thy of God@@ ’@@ s love .
Ti@@ me and time again , however , Jehovah has used the congregation and the elders to con@@ fir@@ m his love for me .
I pray that I will never let him go . ”
If you turn to doing good , will you not be re@@ stor@@ ed to fa@@ v@@ or ?
But if you do not turn to doing good , sin is c@@ r@@ ou@@ ching at the d@@ oor , and its cra@@ ving is to dom@@ in@@ ate you ; but will you get the ma@@ ster@@ y over it ? ”

17 , 18 . ( a ) What does Jehovah want for young people today ?
I was born in a one - roo@@ m lo@@ g c@@ ab@@ in in a very small to@@ wn called Li@@ ber@@ ty , Indi@@ an@@ a , U.S@@ .@@ A .
Later , my mother gave bir@@ th to my two youn@@ ger brothers and my youn@@ ger si@@ ster .
D@@ U@@ R@@ IN@@ G my school years , not much chan@@ ged .
The to@@ wn of Li@@ ber@@ ty was sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by small f@@ ar@@ ms , and the ba@@ si@@ c c@@ rop was cor@@ n .
They wanted me to make the milit@@ ary my care@@ er .
This time , however , they inv@@ ited me to come to a Con@@ greg@@ ation B@@ ook Stu@@ dy , a small meet@@ ing for Bible study and discus@@ sion that was held in their home .
I told them I would think about it .
I cou@@ ld@@ n@@ ’@@ t believe how much they knew about the Bible !
Y@@ ear@@ s before , when I asked my mother about Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , she simply said , “ O@@ h , they worship some old man named Jehovah . ”
But I now felt that my eyes were being open@@ ed !
I started pion@@ eer@@ ing the next year , in 195@@ 8 .
G@@ l@@ or@@ ia was a je@@ wel then , and she is a je@@ wel today .
G@@ l@@ or@@ ia and I got married in Fe@@ bru@@ ary of 195@@ 9 .
He told us that Bethel was not accep@@ ting married cou@@ ples at that time .
Most of our jo@@ bs pa@@ id three dol@@ l@@ ars a day .
E@@ ach week , G@@ l@@ or@@ ia did i@@ ron@@ ing for one family .
I re@@ member one time when we st@@ op@@ ped at a g@@ as st@@ ation .
On the other hand , we had wonder@@ ful times with the brothers , and we loved our ministry !
Me@@ an@@ while , I started a study with the cou@@ ple@@ ’@@ s daugh@@ ter and her husband .
M@@ other and daugh@@ ter both deci@@ ded to serve Jehovah and got baptized .
We had de@@ ar friends in the wh@@ ite congregation .
The K@@ u K@@ lu@@ x K@@ l@@ an ( K@@ K@@ K ) , an organization that pro@@ mo@@ tes ra@@ ci@@ sm and viol@@ ence , was very ac@@ tive then .
In 19@@ 6@@ 2 , I was inv@@ ited to att@@ end the Kingdom M@@ ini@@ stry S@@ ch@@ ool at S@@ outh L@@ ans@@ ing , New York .
However , a tel@@ ep@@ h@@ one comp@@ any in P@@ ine B@@ lu@@ f@@ f had inter@@ vie@@ wed me for a jo@@ b .
If they hi@@ red me , I would be the first bl@@ ack man to work for that comp@@ any .
I had no money to tra@@ vel to New York .
She said , “ G@@ o to school and learn as much as you can , and come back and teach us ! ”
I am so gla@@ d that I did not take that jo@@ b !
Here is how G@@ l@@ or@@ ia re@@ members our time in P@@ ine B@@ lu@@ f@@ f : “ I fel@@ l in love with the ter@@ rit@@ ory !
So we would go in the house - to - house work in the mor@@ ning and then conduct Bible studies the rest of the day , some@@ times until 11 o@@ ’@@ clo@@ ck at night .
While we were pion@@ eer@@ ing in P@@ ine B@@ lu@@ f@@ f , we app@@ lied to become special pion@@ eers .
Bro@@ ther Le@@ on We@@ a@@ ver , now the c@@ oor@@ din@@ ator of the United States B@@ ran@@ ch Com@@ mit@@ te@@ e , was ap@@ pointed to serve as a cir@@ c@@ uit over@@ seer at the same time .
I was ner@@ v@@ ous about be@@ coming a cir@@ c@@ uit over@@ seer .
After I was ap@@ pointed , Bro@@ ther Tho@@ mp@@ son was the first di@@ stri@@ ct over@@ seer I served with .
In those days , a cir@@ c@@ uit over@@ seer received little tra@@ ining .
I re@@ member saying to G@@ l@@ or@@ ia , “ Does he really have to leave now ? ”
One time , the K@@ K@@ K held a mar@@ ch in a to@@ wn we were visit@@ ing in T@@ en@@ nes@@ see .
The following mon@@ th , we began our Bethel service .
G@@ l@@ or@@ ia was a je@@ wel when I married her , and she still is
Then in 199@@ 9 , I was ap@@ pointed to be a member of the Go@@ ver@@ ning Bo@@ dy .
Isaiah 32 : 17 says : “ The result of true righteousness will be peace , and the fru@@ it@@ age of true righteousness will be lasting tr@@ an@@ qu@@ il@@ lity and se@@ cur@@ ity . ”
Se@@ con@@ d , we must pray for God@@ ’@@ s holy spirit .
If the house is de@@ serving , let the peace you wish it come upon it ; but if it is not de@@ serving , let the peace from you return upon you . ”
So I gre@@ e@@ ted her in her own ton@@ gue .
Ta@@ ken by surpri@@ se , she asked me , ‘ What is the reason for your visit ? ’
I poli@@ tel@@ y told her that I wi@@ shed to see the Hi@@ gh Com@@ mission@@ er .
She tel@@ ep@@ hon@@ ed the offi@@ cial , who came out to me@@ et me and gre@@ e@@ ted me in the local language .
After that , he care@@ fully list@@ ened to me as I explained to him the pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful activ@@ ities of the Witnesses . ”
