H@@ it@@ o@@ shi wor@@ ked in the accoun@@ ting off@@ ice of an emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment ag@@ enc@@ y in J@@ ap@@ an .
H@@ it@@ o@@ shi explained that his conscience would not let him do dis@@ hon@@ est work .
As a result , H@@ it@@ os@@ hi@@ ’s su@@ peri@@ or th@@ reat@@ ened to fir@@ e him , and he ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely lost his jo@@ b .
In the mon@@ ths that follow@@ ed , H@@ it@@ o@@ shi became do@@ w@@ n@@ hear@@ ted over his emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment prosp@@ ects .
During one jo@@ b inter@@ view , for instance , H@@ it@@ o@@ shi mentioned that he could not en@@ ga@@ ge in dis@@ hon@@ est work .
H@@ it@@ os@@ hi@@ ’s family and friends encoura@@ ged him to remain firm in his res@@ ol@@ ve to be hon@@ est , yet he began to have some doub@@ ts .
For instance , he said , “ I won@@ dered if being hon@@ est about my faith was a good ide@@ a . ”
H@@ it@@ os@@ hi@@ ’s experience is a dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing remin@@ der that not every@@ one pri@@ z@@ es hon@@ es@@ ty .
In fact , some may even view it as a li@@ ability , partic@@ ularly in the bu@@ sin@@ ess commun@@ ity .
“ I@@ ’@@ m sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by people who are dis@@ hon@@ est , ” said a working woman in S@@ outh A@@ fri@@ c@@ a , “ and some@@ times the pres@@ sure to con@@ form is very great . ”
“ We d@@ id@@ n@@ ’t exp@@ ect l@@ ying to be such a comm@@ on part of da@@ ily life . ”
Is it not st@@ ran@@ ge that most people ab@@ ho@@ r the ide@@ a of being lied to yet there are few practic@@ es more comm@@ on than l@@ ying ?
Why are l@@ ying , ste@@ al@@ ing , and other for@@ ms of dis@@ hon@@ es@@ ty so comm@@ on today ?
How does dis@@ hon@@ es@@ ty affect soci@@ ety as a whole ?
And more important , how can we avoid ge@@ tting cau@@ ght up in these dis@@ hon@@ est practic@@ es ?
“ There are always difficult situ@@ ations that can be sol@@ ved with a little dis@@ hon@@ es@@ ty . ” ​ — Sam@@ an@@ th@@ a , S@@ outh A@@ fri@@ c@@ a .
Do you agre@@ e with that st@@ at@@ ement ?
Like Sam@@ an@@ th@@ a , all of us have fa@@ ced difficult situ@@ ations at one time or another .
When the truth comes to light , however , dis@@ hon@@ es@@ ty often br@@ ings ne@@ g@@ ative con@@ sequ@@ ences .
Tru@@ st can be sha@@ t@@ tered , however , by just one act of dis@@ hon@@ es@@ ty .
And when trust has been bro@@ ken , it can be very difficult to re@@ build .
Thus , dis@@ hon@@ es@@ ty could be lik@@ ened to a v@@ ir@@ us ​ — the more con@@ ta@@ ct you have with a person who is de@@ ce@@ it@@ ful , the greater your ris@@ k of being “ in@@ f@@ ected ” with dis@@ hon@@ es@@ ty yourself .
P@@ le@@ ase consider a few Bible principles .
U@@ t@@ ter@@ ing false and ma@@ li@@ ci@@ ous st@@ at@@ ements that in@@ j@@ ure a person@@ ’s rep@@ ut@@ ation .
“ We trust we have an hon@@ est conscience , as we wish to conduct ourselves hon@@ es@@ tly in all things . ” ​ — Hebrews 13 : 18 .
In the Bible , the orig@@ in@@ al Greek word that is some@@ times trans@@ l@@ ated “ hon@@ es@@ ty ” liter@@ ally means “ something that is in@@ t@@ rin@@ si@@ c@@ ally good . ”
Christians take ser@@ i@@ ously the apostle Paul’s inspired words : “ We wish to conduct ourselves hon@@ es@@ tly in all things . ”
M@@ ost people gl@@ ance at themselves in a mir@@ ro@@ r every mor@@ ning before going out in public .
Because they want to look their best .
God’s Word f@@ ran@@ kly ad@@ m@@ its that we are incl@@ ined to do what is bad .
“ The incl@@ in@@ ation of the heart of man is bad from his y@@ outh up , ” says Genesis 8 : 21 .
The apostle Paul gave a vi@@ vid des@@ crip@@ tion of his own fi@@ ght against sin , saying : “ I really deli@@ ght in the law of God according to the man I am within , but I see in my body another law war@@ ring against the law of my mind and lead@@ ing me cap@@ tive to sin@@ ’s law that is in my body . ” ​ — Romans 7 : 22 , 23 .
We still have a cho@@ ice in the matter .
To be hon@@ est , we need a strong mor@@ al co@@ de .
S@@ ad@@ ly , however , many people sp@@ end more time deci@@ ding on their personal ‘ dre@@ ss co@@ de ’ than they do on thinking about a personal mor@@ al co@@ de .
The book The ( H@@ on@@ est ) Tru@@ th Ab@@ out D@@ is@@ hon@@ es@@ ty put it this way : “ E@@ s@@ s@@ enti@@ ally , we c@@ he@@ at up to the l@@ ev@@ el that al@@ lo@@ ws us to re@@ tain our self - ima@@ ge as reason@@ ab@@ ly hon@@ est individuals . ”
T@@ han@@ k@@ fully , there is .
M@@ illi@@ ons of people the world over have found that the Bible perf@@ ec@@ tly fill@@ s that need .
It gives reli@@ able guidance on such matters as family life , emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment , mor@@ ality , and spiritu@@ ality .
I@@ ts la@@ ws and principles apply to all n@@ ational grou@@ ps , ra@@ ces , tri@@ bes , and pe@@ op@@ les .
By pe@@ ering into the Bible , med@@ it@@ ating on what it says , and ap@@ pl@@ ying its counsel , we can tra@@ in our heart to be hon@@ est and u@@ pri@@ ght .
Still , there is more to w@@ in@@ ning the b@@ att@@ le against dis@@ hon@@ es@@ ty than ga@@ ining an acc@@ ur@@ ate knowledge of the Bible .
After all , we live in a mor@@ ally de@@ pra@@ ved world that pres@@ sures us to accept its cor@@ ru@@ pt standards .
That is why we need to pray to God for his help and support .
By doing so , we can have the courage to stand up for what is right and to be hon@@ est in all things .
H@@ it@@ o@@ shi , qu@@ o@@ ted in the op@@ ening article , pro@@ f@@ ited from having a rep@@ ut@@ ation of being an hon@@ est work@@ er .
“ I am than@@ k@@ ful , ” says H@@ it@@ o@@ shi , “ that I was able to find work that al@@ lo@@ ws me to keep a clean conscience . ”
O@@ thers have found the same to be true .
L@@ ater , I married , and my husband and I began stud@@ ying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses .
We learned that Jehovah * God hat@@ es dis@@ hon@@ est practic@@ es , so we deci@@ ded to change our li@@ f@@ es@@ ty@@ le .
In 199@@ 0 we dedic@@ ated our lives to Jehovah and got baptized as Jehovah’s Witnesses . ” ​ — Proverbs 6 : 16 - 19 .
“ In the past , my house was full of st@@ ol@@ en go@@ o@@ ds , but now it is free from such things ; and this gives me a clean conscience .
Th@@ in@@ king back over my many years of dis@@ hon@@ es@@ ty , I am gr@@ ate@@ ful to Jehovah for his great mercy .
“ When my b@@ os@@ s found out that I had turned down a b@@ ri@@ be from a po@@ t@@ enti@@ al cu@@ st@@ om@@ er , he said to me : ‘ Your God makes you such a trust@@ wor@@ thy person !
To be hon@@ est in all things en@@ ab@@ les me to have a clean conscience before Jehovah God .
“ I work as an ex@@ ecu@@ tive as@@ sist@@ ant at an inter@@ n@@ ational ban@@ k .
The w@@ id@@ es@@ pre@@ ad view is , ‘ W@@ hat@@ ’s the har@@ m in a little dis@@ hon@@ es@@ ty if it pro@@ mot@@ es we@@ al@@ th and helps the ec@@ on@@ om@@ y ? ’
I am res@@ ol@@ ved to remain hon@@ est and face w@@ hatever con@@ sequ@@ ences may come .
My emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ers know that I will not li@@ e to them or for them . ” ​ — To@@ m , Un@@ ited St@@ ates .
When the th@@ i@@ ev@@ es were fin@@ ally reve@@ aled , my emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er than@@ ked me for being hon@@ est .
Be@@ ing hon@@ est in a dis@@ hon@@ est world call@@ s for courage .
But in the end , we can gain the trust and respect of others . ” ​ — Ka@@ or@@ i , J@@ ap@@ an .

Be@@ be had been very close to her father .
The re@@ mar@@ k came from a well - meaning family friend , but Be@@ be found it more c@@ ut@@ ting than comfor@@ ting .
“ His death wa@@ s@@ n@@ ’t for the best , ” she kept re@@ pe@@ ating to her@@ self .
It was clear that when Be@@ be re@@ coun@@ ted the in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent in a book years later , she was still gri@@ ev@@ ing .
As Be@@ be came to see , it can take a long time for someone to over@@ come gri@@ ef , especially when the be@@ re@@ a@@ ved person was very close to the de@@ ce@@ as@@ ed .
In the Bible , death is ap@@ tly descri@@ bed as “ the last ene@@ my . ”
It bre@@ ak@@ s into our lives with ir@@ res@@ is@@ ti@@ ble for@@ ce , often when we are comp@@ let@@ ely un@@ prepar@@ ed , and it ro@@ bs us of those we hold de@@ ar .
N@@ one of us are im@@ mun@@ e to its ra@@ v@@ ages .
So it is not sur@@ pris@@ ing if we feel at a los@@ s when it comes to cop@@ ing with death and its af@@ ter@@ mat@@ h .
Per@@ haps you have won@@ dered : ‘ How long does it take to get over gri@@ ef ?
How can I comfort others who have been be@@ re@@ a@@ ved ?
Is there any hope for our loved ones who have died ? ’
Have you ever had a b@@ ri@@ ef b@@ out with ill@@ ness ?
As an example , consider how the p@@ at@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch Abraham re@@ ac@@ ted when his wife died .
The Bible says that “ Abraham began to m@@ our@@ n and to we@@ ep over Sar@@ ah . ”
The expression “ began to ” su@@ gg@@ ests that it took some time for him to cop@@ e with his los@@ s .
He gri@@ ev@@ ed for “ many days , ” and his family members were un@@ able to comfort him .
S@@ ever@@ al years later , the death of Joseph still we@@ igh@@ ed heav@@ ily on his mind . ​ — Genesis 23 : 2 ; 37 : 34 , 35 ; 42 : 36 ; 45 : 28 .
“ My husband , Ro@@ ber@@ t , died on Ju@@ ly 9 , 200@@ 8 .
S@@ i@@ x years later the pain in my heart is still there .
I don@@ ’t think I will ever get over my los@@ s of Ro@@ b . ” ​ — G@@ ai@@ l , ag@@ ed 60 .
“ Although I have been without my de@@ ar wife for more than 18 years , I still mis@@ s her and gri@@ e@@ ve over my los@@ s .
Wh@@ en@@ ever I see something in nat@@ ure that is att@@ ra@@ c@@ tive , my thoughts go to her , and I cannot help wonder@@ ing how she would have enjo@@ yed see@@ ing what I am see@@ ing . ” ​ — E@@ ti@@ en@@ ne , ag@@ ed 8@@ 4 .
C@@ learly , such pa@@ in@@ ful and long - lasting feelings are only nat@@ ur@@ al .
E@@ ach person gri@@ ev@@ es in his or her own way , and it would be un@@ wise to jud@@ ge the way another person respon@@ ds to tra@@ ge@@ dy .
At the same time , we may need to hold off from con@@ dem@@ ning ourselves if our re@@ action to los@@ s seem@@ s exc@@ essi@@ ve .
As we no@@ te in the “ I@@ m@@ itate Their Fa@@ ith ” article in this issue , Isa@@ a@@ c was still gri@@ ev@@ ing over the los@@ s of his mother , Sar@@ ah , three years after her death . ​ — Genesis 24 : 6@@ 7 .
For instance , you may find that some will adv@@ ise you not to c@@ ry or show your feelings in any way .
O@@ thers may p@@ us@@ h you to do the op@@ pos@@ ite and exp@@ ose all your feelings .
The Bible pres@@ ents a more bal@@ an@@ ced view , one that is supp@@ or@@ ted by mo@@ dern re@@ sear@@ ch .
In some cul@@ tures it is considered un@@ man@@ ly for a ma@@ le to c@@ ry .
But is there a real need to feel as@@ ha@@ m@@ ed about she@@ d@@ ding te@@ ars , even in public ?
M@@ en@@ tal - health ex@@ per@@ ts ac@@ knowledge that te@@ ar@@ fulness is a nor@@ ma@@ l part of gri@@ ev@@ ing .
And gri@@ ev@@ ing may , in time , help you to move on des@@ pite the en@@ or@@ m@@ ity of your los@@ s .
S@@ up@@ pres@@ sing gri@@ ef , however , may do more har@@ m than good .
The Bible len@@ ds no support to the no@@ tion that it is wrong or un@@ man@@ ly to sh@@ ed te@@ ars of gri@@ ef .
At the death of his de@@ ar friend La@@ zar@@ us , Jesus op@@ en@@ ly we@@ pt , even though he had the power to bring the dead back to life ! ​ — John 11 : 33 - 35 .
B@@ ou@@ ts of ang@@ er are often part of gri@@ ev@@ ing , especially in c@@ as@@ es of su@@ d@@ den , un@@ exp@@ ected death .
There are many reasons why a be@@ re@@ a@@ ved person may feel ang@@ ry , such as when thou@@ gh@@ t@@ less and un@@ fo@@ un@@ ded comm@@ ents are made by a resp@@ ected person .
“ I was only 14 years old when my father died , ” expla@@ ins a S@@ outh A@@ fri@@ can man nam@@ ed M@@ i@@ ke .
“ At the f@@ un@@ er@@ al , the An@@ g@@ li@@ can minist@@ er said that God needs good people and takes them early .
* This ang@@ ered me because we des@@ per@@ ately needed our father .
E@@ spe@@ cially in the case of un@@ exp@@ ected death , the be@@ re@@ a@@ ved person may re@@ pe@@ ate@@ dly think , ‘ It might not have happened if only I had done this or that . ’
If you are being pla@@ gu@@ ed by such feelings of gu@@ il@@ t and ang@@ er , it is important not to bo@@ t@@ tle up these emo@@ tions .
Rather , speak to a friend who will listen and reas@@ sure you that such ir@@ r@@ ational feelings are comm@@ on to many be@@ re@@ a@@ ved ones .
The Bible remin@@ ds us : “ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of dist@@ ress . ” ​ — Proverbs 17 : 17 .
The best F@@ ri@@ end a be@@ re@@ a@@ ved person can have is our Creator , Jehovah God .
P@@ our out your heart to him in prayer because “ he car@@ es for you . ”
Moreover , he promises that all who do so will have their thoughts and feelings so@@ o@@ th@@ ed by “ the peace of God that sur@@ pas@@ ses all understanding . ”
Al@@ so , allow God to help you he@@ al by means of his con@@ sol@@ ing Word , the Bible .
Ha@@ ving such thoughts to p@@ on@@ der over may be especially help@@ ful at night when you are alone and find it hard to s@@ le@@ ep . ​ — Isaiah 5@@ 7 : 15 .
R@@ ec@@ ently , a 40 - year - old man , whom we will call Jac@@ k , lost his bel@@ o@@ ved wife to can@@ c@@ er .
“ When I pray to Jehovah , ” he expla@@ ins , “ I never feel alone .
I often wa@@ ke up during the night and cannot get back to s@@ le@@ ep .
After reading and med@@ it@@ ating on comfor@@ ting thoughts from the Scriptures and then p@@ our@@ ing out the feelings of my heart in prayer , I sense a c@@ al@@ m@@ ness and a trans@@ cen@@ ding peace come over me , p@@ ut@@ ting my mind and heart at rest and en@@ ab@@ ling me to s@@ le@@ ep . ”
A young woman nam@@ ed V@@ an@@ es@@ sa lost her mother to ill@@ ness .
She too has experienced the power of prayer .
“ In my most difficult times , ” she says , “ I would just call on God’s name and bre@@ ak down in te@@ ars .
Jehovah list@@ ened to my prayers and always gave me the strength I needed . ”
Some be@@ re@@ av@@ ement coun@@ sel@@ ors adv@@ ise those who are stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ing with gri@@ ef to get involved in helping others or to v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er their time in some commun@@ ity service .
Do@@ ing so can bring joy and may e@@ ase a person@@ ’s gri@@ ef .
Many be@@ re@@ a@@ ved Christians have found that working to help others has brought them great comfort . ​ — 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 .
God feel@@ s for you in your pain . ​ — Psalm 5@@ 5 : 22 ; 1 Peter 5 : 7 .
God pati@@ ently list@@ ens to the prayers of his servants . ​ — Psalm 8@@ 6 : 5 ; 1 Th@@ ess@@ al@@ on@@ ians 5 : 17 .
God mis@@ ses people who have died . ​ — Job 14 : 13 - 15 .
God promises to resurrec@@ t the dead . ​ — Isaiah 26 : 19 ; John 5 : 28 , 29 .
Have you ever felt hel@@ pl@@ ess when someone near to you was gri@@ ev@@ ing over the los@@ s of a loved one ?
S@@ ome@@ times we may feel un@@ sure of what to say or do ​ — so we w@@ in@@ d up saying and doing nothing .
But there are practic@@ al , help@@ ful things that we can do .
O@@ ften , all that is needed is your pres@@ ence along with a si@@ m@@ ple expression , such as “ I am so sor@@ ry . ”
In many cul@@ tures , giving the person a hu@@ g or a g@@ ent@@ le s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze of the ar@@ m is an eff@@ ective way to show you care .
If the be@@ re@@ a@@ ved one wants to talk , listen sy@@ m@@ pa@@ the@@ tic@@ ally .
B@@ est of all , do something for the be@@ re@@ a@@ ved family , perhaps per@@ form@@ ing a cho@@ re the gri@@ ev@@ ing one has not been able to care for , such as co@@ o@@ king a me@@ al , car@@ ing for the children , or helping with f@@ un@@ er@@ al arrang@@ ements if that is des@@ ired .
Such actions may speak l@@ ou@@ der than the most el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent words .
In time , you may be moved to talk about the de@@ ce@@ as@@ ed , perhaps foc@@ using on some good qualities or happy experienc@@ es .
Such con@@ vers@@ ation may even bring a s@@ mil@@ e to the be@@ re@@ a@@ ved person@@ ’s face .
For example , P@@ am ​ — who lost her husband , I@@ an , si@@ x years ag@@ o — ​ says : “ People some@@ times tell me good things that I@@ an did that I never knew about , and that makes my heart feel good . ”
R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers repor@@ t that many be@@ re@@ a@@ ved people receive a lo@@ t of in@@ iti@@ al help but that their needs are soon for@@ go@@ t@@ ten as friends get bu@@ s@@ y again with their own lives .
Therefore , make a point of con@@ ta@@ c@@ ting a be@@ re@@ a@@ ved friend on a reg@@ ular bas@@ is after the los@@ s .
* Many gri@@ ev@@ ing ones deep@@ ly appreciate this opportunity to reli@@ e@@ ve themselves of pro@@ l@@ on@@ ged feelings of gri@@ ef .
Consider the example of Ka@@ or@@ i , a young J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese woman who was dev@@ as@@ t@@ ated by the los@@ s of her mother follow@@ ed by the los@@ s of her older sister 15 mon@@ ths later .
T@@ han@@ k@@ fully , she received on@@ going support from loyal friends .
One nam@@ ed R@@ it@@ su@@ ko is much older than Ka@@ or@@ i and offered to be her close friend .
“ To be hon@@ est , ” says Ka@@ or@@ i , “ I wa@@ s@@ n@@ ’t happy about that .
I d@@ id@@ n@@ ’t want anyone to take the place of my mother , and I d@@ id@@ n@@ ’t think that anyone could .
However , because of the way Ma@@ ma R@@ it@@ su@@ ko tre@@ ated me , I came to feel close to her .
E@@ very we@@ ek , we went out in the ev@@ ang@@ eli@@ zing work together and went to Christian meetings together .
She inv@@ ited me to have te@@ a with her , brought me me@@ als , and wrote me let@@ ters and car@@ ds many times .
Ma@@ ma R@@ it@@ su@@ ko@@ ’s pos@@ itive attitude had a good influence on me . ”
T@@ w@@ el@@ ve years have pas@@ sed since Ka@@ or@@ i@@ ’s mother died , and today she and her husband are full - time ev@@ ang@@ eli@@ z@@ ers .
“ Ma@@ ma R@@ it@@ su@@ ko , ” Ka@@ or@@ i says , “ continu@@ es to show her concern .
When I go back home , I always vis@@ it her and enjoy her up@@ building associ@@ ation . ”
A@@ no@@ ther example of someone who benef@@ ited from on@@ going support is P@@ ol@@ i , one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in C@@ y@@ p@@ rus .
P@@ ol@@ i had a kind husband , So@@ z@@ o@@ s , who set a good example as a Christian shepher@@ d by often inv@@ iting or@@ p@@ han@@ s and w@@ ido@@ ws to their home for associ@@ ation and a me@@ al .
S@@ ad@@ ly , at the age of 5@@ 3 , So@@ z@@ o@@ s died of a bra@@ in t@@ um@@ or .
There , they began associ@@ ating with a congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
“ The friends in my new congregation , ” rec@@ all@@ s P@@ ol@@ i , “ did not know anything about our past and our difficult circumstances .
But that did not sto@@ p them from appro@@ aching us and em@@ bra@@ cing us with their kind words and practic@@ al help .
How precious that help was , especially at that time , when my son needed his father most !
Those taking the lead in the congregation showed a great deal of personal interest in Daniel .
One in partic@@ ular made sure to incl@@ ude Daniel when enjo@@ ying associ@@ ation with friends or when going out to pla@@ y b@@ all . ”
Bo@@ th mother and son are doing well today .
To be sure , there are many ways we can offer practic@@ al help and comfort to those who m@@ our@@ n .
The Bible also comfor@@ ts us by means of a thr@@ ill@@ ing hope for the future .
Some have even mar@@ ked the d@@ ate of the death on their c@@ al@@ en@@ dar as a remin@@ der to offer comfort when it may be most needed ​ — on or near the d@@ ate of the los@@ s .
You may rec@@ all that G@@ ai@@ l , mentioned ear@@ lier in this ser@@ ies , doub@@ ts whether she will ever get over the death of her husband , Ro@@ b .
However , she is loo@@ king for@@ ward to see@@ ing him again in God’s promised new world .
My feelings really go out to people who have lost someone they love but who are not aw@@ are of this hope of see@@ ing their loved one again . ”
So@@ on , God will do just that ​ — for Job and coun@@ t@@ less others — ​ when this earth is trans@@ formed into a par@@ adise .
“ There is going to be a resurrection , ” the Bible con@@ fir@@ ms at Acts 24 : 15 .
“ Do not be a@@ ma@@ zed at this , ” Jesus as@@ sures us , “ for the ho@@ ur is coming in which all those in the me@@ mor@@ ial t@@ om@@ bs will hear his vo@@ ice and come out . ”
The same will happ@@ en to all who respond with appreciation to God’s mer@@ ci@@ ful pro@@ vision of a resurrection to life on earth .
If you have suff@@ ered the los@@ s of someone de@@ ar to you , the information we have discus@@ sed may not comp@@ let@@ ely take away your gri@@ ef .
But by med@@ it@@ ating on God’s promises found in the Bible , you can find real hope and the strength to keep going . ​ — 1 Th@@ ess@@ al@@ on@@ ians 4 : 13 .

In the sp@@ ring of 33 C.E . , Jesus the Na@@ zar@@ ene was ex@@ ecu@@ ted .
He had been fal@@ sel@@ y char@@ ged with se@@ dition , sa@@ v@@ ag@@ ely be@@ at@@ en , and na@@ iled to a s@@ take .
But God ra@@ ised him back to life , and 40 days later , Jesus as@@ cen@@ ded to heaven .
This ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ary account comes to us from the four G@@ os@@ p@@ els of the Christian Greek Scriptures , com@@ mon@@ ly called the New T@@ es@@ tam@@ ent .
On the other hand , if those events really did happ@@ en , then there is a b@@ right future for mankind , one in which you can share .
So , are the G@@ os@@ pe@@ l accoun@@ ts fact or fic@@ tion ?
Un@@ like fan@@ ci@@ ful le@@ gen@@ ds , the G@@ os@@ pe@@ l writ@@ ings reflect pa@@ in@@ sta@@ king acc@@ ur@@ ac@@ y and attention to de@@ ta@@ il .
For example , they abo@@ und with nam@@ es of real plac@@ es , many of which can be vis@@ ited today .
They tell about real people , whose exist@@ ence has been cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ated by sec@@ ular hist@@ or@@ ians . ​ — Luke 3 : 1 , 2 , 23 .
Jesus himself is mentioned by sec@@ ular writ@@ ers of the first and second centur@@ ies .
* His man@@ ner of death , as descri@@ bed in the G@@ os@@ p@@ els , agre@@ es with Rom@@ an ex@@ ecu@@ ti@@ onal me@@ tho@@ ds of the time .
Moreover , events are rel@@ ated in a fa@@ c@@ tu@@ al and can@@ did man@@ ner ​ — even port@@ ray@@ ing some of Jesus ’ disciples un@@ fav@@ or@@ ab@@ ly .
All these fa@@ ct@@ ors str@@ ong@@ ly indic@@ ate that the G@@ os@@ pe@@ l writ@@ ers were hon@@ est and acc@@ ur@@ ate in what they wrote about Jesus .
While it is gener@@ ally accepted that Jesus lived and died , some would question his resurrection .
Even his apostles did not believe the in@@ iti@@ al repor@@ t of his having re@@ turned to life .
All doubt was re@@ moved , however , when they and other disciples saw the resurrec@@ ted Jesus on se@@ par@@ ate occas@@ ions .
In fact , in one case , there were more than 5@@ 00 e@@ y@@ e@@ w@@ itnesses present . ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 6 .
At the ris@@ k of being ar@@ rest@@ ed and kill@@ ed , the disciples coura@@ ge@@ ously pro@@ claim@@ ed Jesus ’ resurrection to all ​ — even to the very ones who had ex@@ ecu@@ ted him .
W@@ ould so many disciples have been so bo@@ ld if they were not ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely sure that Jesus had really been resurrec@@ ted ?
In fact , the re@@ ality of the resurrection of Jesus is the d@@ ri@@ ving for@@ ce be@@ hin@@ d the imp@@ act that Christi@@ an@@ ity has had on the world both then and now .
The G@@ os@@ pe@@ l accoun@@ ts of Jesus ’ death and resurrection bear all the necessar@@ y mar@@ ks of an au@@ th@@ enti@@ c hist@@ or@@ ical rec@@ ord .
C@@ are@@ fully reading them will con@@ vin@@ ce you that these events really happened .
Your con@@ vic@@ tion can be further strength@@ ened when you understand why they took place .
T@@ ac@@ it@@ us , born about 5@@ 5 C.E . , wrote that “ Christ@@ us , from whom the name [ Christians ] had its orig@@ in , suff@@ ered the ex@@ tre@@ me p@@ en@@ al@@ ty during the re@@ ign of T@@ ib@@ eri@@ us at the hands of one of our pro@@ c@@ ur@@ at@@ ors , P@@ on@@ ti@@ us P@@ il@@ at@@ us . ”
Jesus is also ref@@ er@@ red to by Su@@ e@@ ton@@ i@@ us ( first century ) ; Jewish hist@@ or@@ ian Jos@@ e@@ ph@@ us ( first century ) ; and P@@ l@@ in@@ y the Yo@@ ung@@ er , gover@@ nor of B@@ ith@@ y@@ ni@@ a ( early second century ) .
Then , too , it is un@@ likely that Jesus ’ many op@@ pos@@ ers would writ@@ e anything that would l@@ end cre@@ di@@ b@@ ility to the repor@@ ts about him .
Re@@ gar@@ ding Jesus ’ resurrection , Peter , one of his apostles , explained : “ God ra@@ ised this one up on the th@@ ir@@ d day and allow@@ ed him to become manif@@ est , not to all the people , but to w@@ itnesses appointed be@@ fore@@ hand by God , to us , who ate and d@@ ran@@ k with him after his ris@@ ing from the dead . ”
Matthe@@ w@@ ’s G@@ os@@ pe@@ l tell@@ s us that when the religious enemies heard repor@@ ts of Jesus ’ resurrection , they sc@@ he@@ m@@ ed to su@@ p@@ pres@@ s them . ​ — Matthew 28 : 11 - 15 .
Does this mean that Jesus wanted his resurrection to be kept sec@@ re@@ t ?
No , for Peter went on to say : “ He or@@ dered us to preach to the people and to give a thor@@ ough witness that this is the one dec@@ re@@ ed by God to be jud@@ ge of the living and the dead . ”
True Christians have done and are doing just that . ​ — Acts 10 : 42 .
“ T@@ hr@@ ough one man [ Adam ] sin en@@ tered into the world and death through sin . ” ​ — Romans 5 : 12
What would you say if you were asked , “ Do you want to live forever ? ”
M@@ ost people would pro@@ bab@@ ly say that they want to but that they feel it is un@@ re@@ al@@ is@@ tic to consider it .
De@@ ath is a nor@@ ma@@ l part of life , they say , the nat@@ ur@@ al out@@ come of our exist@@ ence .
Su@@ pp@@ ose , though , that the question were turned around and you were asked , “ Are you ready to di@@ e ? ”
Un@@ der nor@@ ma@@ l circumstances , most people would answer no .
The Bible shows that God cre@@ ated humans with the desire and the will to live .
In fact , it says that “ he has even put e@@ tern@@ ity in their heart . ” ​ — E@@ c@@ cl@@ es@@ i@@ as@@ tes 3 : 11 .
The re@@ ality , though , is that humans do not live forever .
Fur@@ ther@@ more , has God done anything to re@@ me@@ dy the situation ?
The Bib@@ le’s ans@@ wers are hear@@ ten@@ ing , and they have a direc@@ t be@@ aring on why Jesus suff@@ ered and died .
The first three chap@@ ters of the Bible book of Genesis tell us that God set before the first human couple , Adam and Eve , the prosp@@ ect of un@@ en@@ ding life and told them what they would have to do to gain it .
Then the account descri@@ bes how they fa@@ iled to obey God and lost that prosp@@ ect .
The st@@ ory is told simply ​ — so simply that some are quic@@ k to dis@@ mis@@ s it as fol@@ k@@ l@@ ore .
But Genesis , like the G@@ os@@ p@@ els , gives every indic@@ ation of being a fa@@ c@@ tu@@ al , hist@@ or@@ ical rec@@ ord .
What has been the result of A@@ dam@@ ’s fa@@ il@@ ure to obey ?
The Bible ans@@ wers this way : “ T@@ hr@@ ough one man [ Adam ] sin en@@ tered into the world and death through sin , and so death sp@@ read to all men because they had all sin@@ ned . ”
He thus lost the prosp@@ ect of end@@ less life and even@@ tually died .
Be@@ ing his des@@ c@@ end@@ ants , we have inher@@ ited his sin@@ ful con@@ dition .
But has God done anything to re@@ me@@ dy the situation ?
Yes , God made arrang@@ ements to re@@ de@@ em , or bu@@ y back , what Adam had lost for his des@@ c@@ end@@ ants , nam@@ ely , the prosp@@ ect of end@@ less life .
“ The wa@@ ges sin pa@@ ys is death , ” says the Bible at Romans 6 : 23 .
This means that death is the con@@ sequ@@ ence of sin .
L@@ ik@@ e@@ wise , we sin and are therefore subj@@ ect to sin@@ ’s wa@@ ges , death .
But we were born in this sin@@ ful con@@ dition through no fa@@ ul@@ t of our own .
So God lo@@ v@@ ingly sent his Son , Jesus , to accept ‘ the wa@@ ges of sin ’ for us .
Jesus ’ death op@@ ens the way to a happy , end@@ less life
Since one man , the perfect man Adam , brought sin and death on us through dis@@ obedience , a perfect man obedi@@ ent even t@@ ill death was needed to re@@ le@@ ase us from that bur@@ den .
The Bible expla@@ ins it this way : “ Just as through the dis@@ obedience of the one man many were made sin@@ n@@ ers , so also through the obedience of the one person many will be made righteous . ”
He left heaven , became a perfect man * , and died in our be@@ half .
As a result , it is possible for us to have a righteous standing with God and gain the prosp@@ ect of end@@ less life .
Why , though , was it necessar@@ y for Jesus to di@@ e to accompl@@ ish this ?
C@@ ould not Al@@ mi@@ ghty God have simply is@@ su@@ ed a dec@@ ree that A@@ dam@@ ’s des@@ c@@ end@@ ants be allow@@ ed to live forever ?
H@@ ad God set justice as@@ ide in this instance , people might have won@@ dered whether he would do so in other matters as well .
For example , would he be fa@@ ir in determin@@ ing who among A@@ dam@@ ’s off@@ sp@@ ring qu@@ ali@@ fy for e@@ tern@@ al life ?
C@@ ould he be trust@@ ed to keep his promises ?
God’s ad@@ he@@ ren@@ ce to justice in working out our salvation is as@@ sur@@ ance to us that he will always do what is right .
By Jesus ’ sacri@@ fi@@ cial death , God op@@ ened the way to end@@ less life in Par@@ adise on earth .
No@@ te Jesus ’ words as recorded at John 3 : 16 : “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - be@@ go@@ t@@ ten Son , so that every@@ one exerc@@ ising faith in him might not be destro@@ yed but have everlasting life . ”
Jesus ’ death is thus an expression not only of God’s un@@ fa@@ il@@ ing justice but , more spe@@ cially , of his great love for humans .
However , why did Jesus have to suff@@ er and di@@ e in the pa@@ in@@ ful way that was descri@@ bed in the G@@ os@@ p@@ els ?
By subj@@ ecting himself to the ex@@ tre@@ me t@@ est and rema@@ ining faithful , Jesus re@@ fu@@ ted once and for all the D@@ ev@@ il@@ ’s cla@@ im that humans would not remain loyal to God when under tri@@ al .
That cla@@ im might have seem@@ ed v@@ ali@@ d after Satan in@@ du@@ ced perfect Adam to sin .
But Jesus ​ — who was A@@ dam@@ ’s perfect equ@@ i@@ v@@ al@@ ent — ​ rema@@ ined obedi@@ ent des@@ pite s@@ ev@@ ere suffering .
He thus proved that Adam too could have obe@@ yed God if he had cho@@ s@@ en to do so .
By end@@ uring under tri@@ al , Jesus left us a mo@@ de@@ l to follow .
God re@@ war@@ ded his S@@ on@@ ’s perfect obedience , gran@@ ting Jesus immor@@ tal life in heaven .
Jesus indic@@ ated what we need to do when he said : “ This means everlasting life , their coming to know you , the only true God , and the one whom you sent , Jesus Christ . ” ​ — John 17 : 3 .

[ 1 ] ( par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph 14 ) See chapter 21 of the book God’s Kingdom R@@ ul@@ es !
During an asse@@ mb@@ ly , a brother asked me if I would like to preach .
We went to the ter@@ rit@@ ory , and he gave me some bo@@ o@@ k@@ le@@ ts about God’s Kingdom .
One of the sisters there gave us children Bible less@@ ons based on the Bible and the book The Har@@ p of God .
As a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er , I enjo@@ yed giving people hope from God’s Word .
The brother st@@ op@@ p@@ ed his b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le and asked me to s@@ it down with him on a lo@@ g .
He said : “ Who gave you authority to jud@@ ge who is a go@@ at ?
Le@@ t@@ ’s just be happy giving people the good news and leave the jud@@ ging to Jehovah . ”
A@@ no@@ ther older brother taught me that to find happiness in giving , we some@@ times have to endure pati@@ ently .
Ye@@ ars later , his pati@@ ence was re@@ war@@ ded when his wife was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
After the war , I pione@@ ered for two years in sou@@ ther@@ n I@@ rel@@ and .
We did not reali@@ ze how much power the pri@@ ests had .
I had never sa@@ iled before , so I was exc@@ ited .

So I said to my@@ self , ‘ R@@ on@@ al@@ d , if you want this gir@@ l , y@@ ou@@ ’@@ ve got to act quic@@ kly . ’
After three we@@ e@@ ks I pro@@ posed , and after si@@ x we@@ e@@ ks we were married .
Ma@@ x@@ ine and I were assign@@ ed as mission@@ ari@@ es to P@@ u@@ er@@ to R@@ ic@@ o , so I never went out on the new bo@@ at .
For example , in the v@@ il@@ la@@ ge of P@@ o@@ tal@@ a P@@ as@@ t@@ ill@@ o , there were two W@@ itness fam@@ il@@ ies with many children , and I used to pla@@ y the fl@@ ut@@ e for them .
I asked one of the little gir@@ ls , H@@ il@@ da , if she wanted to come and preach with us .
We b@@ ought her a pa@@ ir , and she came preaching with us .
She was about to leave for her assign@@ ment in E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , and she said : “ You don@@ ’t recogni@@ ze me , do you ?
I am the little gir@@ l from P@@ as@@ t@@ ill@@ o who had no sho@@ es . ”
At first , L@@ en@@ n@@ ar@@ t Joh@@ n@@ son and I did most of the work .
Na@@ than K@@ nor@@ r , who was then taking the lead among Jehovah’s Witnesses , came to P@@ u@@ er@@ to R@@ ic@@ o .
L@@ ater , he gave me strong counsel about being organi@@ zed and said that he was dis@@ appointed in me .
Father did not accept the truth when M@@ other and I did .
My de@@ ar wife , Ma@@ x@@ ine , died in 20@@ 11 .
I am really loo@@ king for@@ ward to see@@ ing her again in the resurrection .
After 60 years on the is@@ land , I felt as P@@ u@@ er@@ to R@@ i@@ can as a co@@ qu@@ í , the p@@ op@@ ular little P@@ u@@ er@@ to R@@ i@@ can t@@ ree f@@ ro@@ g that s@@ ings ko - ke@@ e , ko - ke@@ e at du@@ s@@ k .

When she se@@ es the out@@ come , she kno@@ ws that Jehovah is helping us .
This has done won@@ ders for her faith in God and in the Bible . ”
The first article shows how our faith can gro@@ w and remain strong .
Let me expla@@ in what led to that con@@ vers@@ ation .
I WA@@ S born in W@@ ic@@ h@@ ita , K@@ an@@ sa@@ s , U@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ A . , on De@@ ce@@ mb@@ er 10 , 19@@ 36 , the ol@@ des@@ t of four children .
Then a sol@@ di@@ er wal@@ ked by , and the do@@ ct@@ or y@@ el@@ led , “ Do something about this y@@ el@@ low co@@ ward ! ”
The sol@@ di@@ er could see that the man was d@@ run@@ k , so he told him , “ G@@ o home and so@@ ber up ! ”
He o@@ w@@ ned two bar@@ ber@@ sho@@ ps in W@@ ic@@ h@@ ita , and the do@@ ct@@ or was one of his c@@ li@@ ents !
With my parents , going to a conven@@ tion in W@@ ic@@ h@@ ita in the 19@@ 40 ’ s

We were assign@@ ed to special pioneer in W@@ al@@ nu@@ t R@@ id@@ ge , Ar@@ kan@@ sa@@ s .
Then in 19@@ 6@@ 2 , we were thr@@ ill@@ ed to receive an inv@@ itation to the 3@@ 7@@ th clas@@ s of G@@ ile@@ ad .
In the ministry in Na@@ ir@@ o@@ bi with Mary and Chr@@ is K@@ ana@@ iya
So@@ on after , our first daugh@@ ter , K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly , was born , and 17 mon@@ ths later , we had S@@ te@@ p@@ han@@ y .
We would also go c@@ am@@ p@@ ing with them and would have very enjo@@ y@@ able con@@ vers@@ ations around the c@@ am@@ p@@ fir@@ e .
We arrang@@ ed to have some who were in the full - time ministry sta@@ y in our home .
They were sho@@ c@@ ked and star@@ ted to c@@ ry and said that they wanted to study .
With the help and direction of God’s organization , we did our best to ra@@ ise them to love Jehovah .
On a later tri@@ p , K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly me@@ t one of his work@@ mat@@ es , B@@ ri@@ an L@@ le@@ w@@ ell@@ y@@ n .
So they did sta@@ y free until they were at le@@ ast 23 .
At the same time , B@@ ri@@ an and K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly were inv@@ ited to work at L@@ on@@ don Bethel and later were trans@@ f@@ er@@ red to Mal@@ aw@@ i Bethel .
The day after we left for the Watchtower E@@ duc@@ ational C@@ en@@ ter in P@@ att@@ er@@ son , L@@ inda called to tell us that M@@ other had died .
N@@ ext , we taught the course in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we and then in Z@@ am@@ bi@@ a .

( Read 2 Chr@@ on@@ ic@@ les 14 : 11 . )
What would your heart move you to do ?
A@@ sa@@ ’s son Jeho@@ sha@@ p@@ hat “ kept wal@@ king in the way of his father A@@ sa . ”
( Read 2 Chr@@ on@@ ic@@ les 20 : 2 - 4 . )
( Read Isaiah 37 : 15 - 20 . )
( Read 2 K@@ ings 20 : 1 - 3 . )
( Read 2 Chr@@ on@@ ic@@ les 34 : 18 , 19 . )
( b ) What will we discus@@ s in the next article ?
Why will we consider the examples of four k@@ ings of Judah ?
( Read 2 Chr@@ on@@ ic@@ les 16 : 7 - 9 . )
( Read 2 Chr@@ on@@ ic@@ les 32 : 31 . )
Many praise him for what he has done .
( Read 2 Chr@@ on@@ ic@@ les 35 : 20 - 22 . )
The Bible says that N@@ ec@@ ho@@ ’s words were “ from the m@@ outh of God . ”
Let us med@@ itate on these Bible accoun@@ ts and be than@@ k@@ ful that Jehovah has provided them for us !
How many vo@@ ws have you made to Jehovah ?
What about your dedic@@ ation vo@@ w or your marriage vo@@ w ?
When we believe that we have person@@ ally experienced or ob@@ served an in@@ justice , our faith , humility , and lo@@ yal@@ ty may be tes@@ ted .
“ The world is pas@@ sing away and so is its desire , but the one who does the will of God rema@@ ins forever . ” ​ — 1 J@@ O@@ H@@ N 2 : 17 .
What will Jehovah do about wicked people and cor@@ ru@@ pt organiz@@ ations ?
The Bible says : “ The world is pas@@ sing away . ”
There is no dar@@ k@@ ness or deep sha@@ do@@ w where wr@@ ong@@ do@@ ers can con@@ ce@@ al themselves . ”
L@@ ater in the same p@@ salm , we read : “ The righteous will poss@@ ess the earth , and they will live forever on it . ”
Who are “ the mee@@ k ” and “ the righteous ” ?
Why can we be sure that the new earth will be well - organi@@ zed ?
After Ar@@ mag@@ ed@@ don , will there be any organization on earth ?
So the “ new earth ” will be organi@@ zed .
What kind of wrong activities are comm@@ on where you live , and how are you and your family aff@@ ected ?
What do we learn from Jehovah’s judgment of So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ r@@ ah ?
( Read 2 Peter 2 : 6 - 8 . )
( Read Psalm 46 : 8 , 9 . )
What are some things that will be g@@ one forever after Ar@@ mag@@ ed@@ don ?
I@@ ll@@ ustr@@ ate . ( b ) How can we be sure that we will remain after this old world is g@@ one ?
“ W@@ I@@ L@@ L the Jud@@ ge of all the earth not do what is right ? ”
Because Jehovah is the great@@ est example of justice and righteousness .
Christians exp@@ ect to experience some in@@ justice ou@@ ts@@ ide the Christian congregation .
In 19@@ 46 , he atten@@ ded the e@@ igh@@ th clas@@ s of G@@ ile@@ ad S@@ cho@@ ol in New Y@@ or@@ k , U@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ A .
After gra@@ du@@ ation , he was even@@ tually assign@@ ed to the cir@@ cu@@ it work in S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land .
What examples will we consider in this article and in the next ?
In this article , we will consider Abraha@@ m@@ ’s great - gran@@ d@@ son Joseph and his experience with his brothers .
10 , 11 . ( a ) What in@@ jus@@ tic@@ es did Joseph experience ?
( Read Matthew 5 : 23 , 24 ; 18 : 15 . )
Lo@@ yal@@ ty to Jehovah and to our brothers will prot@@ ect us from making such a mis@@ take .
M@@ ost important , he did not allow the im@@ perf@@ ec@@ tions and wrong actions of others to se@@ par@@ ate him from Jehovah .
Why should we draw even clo@@ s@@ er to Jehovah if we experience in@@ justice in the congregation ?
How can we show that we have confidence in “ the Jud@@ ge of all the earth ” ?
See W@@ ill@@ i D@@ i@@ e@@ h@@ l@@ ’s life st@@ ory , “ Jehovah Is My God , in W@@ ho@@ m I Will Tru@@ st , ” in the No@@ v@@ em@@ ber 1 , 199@@ 1 , issue of The Watchtower .
( See op@@ ening pic@@ tures . ) ( b ) What questions will be ans@@ we@@ red in this article ?
They are exc@@ ell@@ ent examples for men and women today who cho@@ ose to make vo@@ ws to Jehovah .

What less@@ ons can we learn from Je@@ ph@@ th@@ ah and H@@ ann@@ ah ?
2 , 3 . ( a ) What is a vo@@ w ?
( b ) What do the Scriptures say about making vo@@ ws to God ?
( a ) How serious is it to make a vo@@ w to God ?
( b ) What do we want to learn about Je@@ ph@@ th@@ ah and H@@ ann@@ ah ?
( a ) How eas@@ y was it for Je@@ ph@@ th@@ ah and his daugh@@ ter to pa@@ y his vo@@ w to God ?
Je@@ ph@@ th@@ ah said : “ I have op@@ ened my m@@ outh to Jehovah , and I am un@@ able to turn back . ”
( b ) What did H@@ ann@@ ah’s vo@@ w mean for Samu@@ el ?
She took Samu@@ el to H@@ i@@ gh P@@ ri@@ est El@@ i at the tab@@ er@@ n@@ ac@@ le in S@@ hi@@ lo@@ h and said : “ It was for this bo@@ y that I pray@@ ed , and Jehovah gran@@ ted my pe@@ t@@ ition that I asked of him .
The second most important vo@@ w that a person can make is the marriage vo@@ w .
What does the Bible say about div@@ or@@ ce and se@@ par@@ ation ?
( Read 1 Corinthians 7 : 10 , 11 . )
One couple said : “ Since we have been stud@@ ying this bro@@ ch@@ ure , our marriage has been happ@@ i@@ er than ever . ”
We are doing much better now as a couple . ”
18 , 19 . ( a ) What have many Christian parents done ?
( b ) What can be said about those who are in special full - time service ?
S@@ pe@@ cial full - time service vo@@ w ( See par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph 19 )
It is not the people but their assign@@ ments that are vie@@ wed as special .
See the A@@ pp@@ en@@ di@@ x article “ The Bib@@ le@@ ʼ@@ s V@@ i@@ ew on D@@ i@@ v@@ or@@ ce and Se@@ par@@ ation ” in the book “ Keep Y@@ ourselves in Go@@ d@@ ʼ@@ s Lo@@ ve . ”
Does the Al@@ mi@@ ghty care that you are righteous , or does he gain anything because you follow the course of integrity ? ”
( b ) How did Israel de@@ fe@@ at J@@ abin@@ ’s ar@@ my ?
( Read Jud@@ ges 4 : 14 - 16 . )
The tor@@ ren@@ t of K@@ is@@ ho@@ n wa@@ sh@@ ed them away . ”
See the article “ An@@ x@@ i@@ ety Ab@@ out M@@ one@@ y ” in the Ju@@ ly 1 , 20@@ 15 , issue of The Watchtower .
1 , 2 . ( a ) What in@@ justice did N@@ abo@@ th and his sons experience ?
( b ) What two qualities will we consider in this article ?
What kind of man was N@@ abo@@ th , and why did he ref@@ use to sel@@ l his vin@@ e@@ yar@@ d to King A@@ ha@@ b ?
N@@ abo@@ th was faithful to Jehovah at a time when most Israelites were following the bad example of King A@@ ha@@ b and his wife , wicked Q@@ u@@ e@@ en Je@@ ze@@ be@@ l .
Read 1 K@@ ings 21 : 1 - 3 .
He resp@@ ec@@ t@@ fully explained : “ It is un@@ thin@@ k@@ able , from Jehovah’s stan@@ d@@ point , for me to give you the inher@@ it@@ ance of my fore@@ fa@@ thers . ”
Why would humility have been a prot@@ ection to N@@ abo@@ th@@ ’s family and friends ?
( Read De@@ u@@ ter@@ on@@ om@@ y 32 : 3 , 4 . )
( b ) In what ways will humility prot@@ ect us ?
How will you respond if the elders an@@ no@@ un@@ ce a decision that you do not agre@@ e with ?
What account will we now consider , and why ?
How was Peter cor@@ rec@@ ted , and what questions ar@@ ise ?
In fact , he was later inspired to writ@@ e two let@@ ters that became part of the Bible .
3 Hel@@ p@@ ing “ F@@ o@@ re@@ ign R@@ es@@ id@@ ents ” to “ Ser@@ ve Jehovah With Re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing ”
The second article consid@@ ers how ap@@ pl@@ ying Bible principles will help im@@ mi@@ gran@@ t parents to make decisions that will benefit their children .
“ We could see people run@@ ning , sho@@ o@@ ting .
My parents and 11 of us si@@ bl@@ ings fl@@ ed for our lives with only the clo@@ th@@ es on our ba@@ c@@ ks .
How did Jesus and many of his disciples become re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es ?
He said : “ When they pers@@ ec@@ ut@@ e you in one city , f@@ le@@ e to another . ”
( b ) are living in a c@@ am@@ p ?
My fe@@ et were so s@@ w@@ ol@@ l@@ en that I told my family to go on without me .
My father ​ — not about to ab@@ an@@ don me to the re@@ be@@ l for@@ ces — ​ car@@ ri@@ ed me .
They g@@ os@@ si@@ p@@ ed , d@@ ran@@ k , gam@@ bl@@ ed , sto@@ le , and were immor@@ al . ”
( Read 1 John 3 : 17 , 18 . )
( b ) Why do they need our pati@@ ent help ?
They need to see that we care about them .
( b ) How can re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es show gr@@ at@@ itude ?
How can we help our brothers and sisters who are re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es ?
( a ) What temp@@ tation do re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es need to res@@ ist ?
This is all you need ! ’ ” ​ — Read 1 Timothy 6 : 8 .
They need to sense Jehovah’s love and compas@@ sion among their fellow Christians .
Many of to@@ da@@ y’s re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es come from coun@@ tri@@ es where our preaching work is rest@@ ri@@ cted .
She said : “ The brothers there tre@@ ated them like close relati@@ ves , provid@@ ing food , clo@@ th@@ es , shel@@ ter , and t@@ ran@@ sp@@ or@@ tation .
Who el@@ se would w@@ el@@ come str@@ ang@@ ers into their home just because they worship the same God ?
On@@ ly Jehovah’s Witnesses ! ” ​ — Read John 13 : 35 .
As soon as possible after a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e arri@@ ves , elders should follow the direction in O@@ r@@ gani@@ zed to Do Jehovah’s Will , chapter 8 , par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph 30 .
In the mean@@ time , they can ask discre@@ et questions about a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e@@ ’s congregation and ministry to discer@@ n his spiritual con@@ dition .
“ No greater joy do I have than this : that I should hear that my children go on wal@@ king in the truth . ” ​ — 3 J@@ O@@ H@@ N 4 .
How can parents set a good example for their children ?
How can family head@@ s deci@@ de which language congregation the family will att@@ end ?
How can others help im@@ mi@@ gran@@ t parents and their children ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What proble@@ m do many im@@ mi@@ gran@@ t children experience ?
I cou@@ l@@ d@@ n@@ ’t understand the meetings , and I d@@ id@@ n@@ ’t identi@@ fy with my parents ’ cul@@ ture . ”
3 , 4 . ( a ) How can parents set a good example for their children ?
( b ) What should parents not exp@@ ect of their children ?
When your children see you “ seeking first the Kingdom , ” they learn to dep@@ end on Jehovah for their da@@ ily needs .
N@@ ever get so bu@@ s@@ y that you do not have time for your children .
How may your children benefit from lear@@ ning your language ?
Par@@ ents , if that descri@@ bes your children , can you learn at le@@ ast some of the lo@@ cal language ?
A child who commun@@ ic@@ ates best in another spo@@ ken language deser@@ ves the same concern , would you not agre@@ e ?
If that is your situation , you can still help your children to come to know and love Jehovah .
How can parents help children who may need to study in two langu@@ ages ?
( a ) Who must deci@@ de which language congregation to att@@ end ?
That may not be the case when children do not fully understand the language .
( Read 1 Corinthians 14 : 9 , 11 . )
But when we saw that they were ge@@ tting little benefit from the meetings in our language , we deci@@ ded to move to the lo@@ cal - language congregation .
To@@ gether , we reg@@ ularly atten@@ ded meetings and sh@@ ared in the ministry .
We also inv@@ ited lo@@ cal friends to jo@@ in us for me@@ als and exc@@ ur@@ sions .
All of this helped our children to get to know the brothers and to get to know Jehovah , not only as their God but also as their Father and F@@ ri@@ end .
We considered this to be much more important than their ma@@ st@@ ering our language . ”
Samu@@ el ad@@ ds : “ To keep ourselves spiritually strong , my wife and I also atten@@ ded meetings in our language .
Our three children are all serving Jehovah in the full - time ministry . ”
“ I knew the bas@@ ic@@ s of my parents ’ language , but the language spo@@ ken at the meetings was over my head , ” rec@@ all@@ s Kr@@ ist@@ ina .
Yo@@ ung people , do you think that you would pre@@ f@@ er being part of a lo@@ cal - language congregation ?
“ When my si@@ bl@@ ings and I got into our te@@ ens , we wanted to s@@ w@@ it@@ ch to the lo@@ cal - language congregation , ” says Na@@ di@@ a , who now ser@@ ves at Bethel .
“ Now we@@ ’@@ re gr@@ ate@@ ful that our parents wor@@ ked hard to teach us their language and kept us in the fore@@ ign - language congregation .
It has en@@ ri@@ ched our lives and bro@@ ad@@ ened our opportun@@ ities to help others get to know Jehovah . ”
( b ) How can parents get help in teaching their children the truth ?
( Read Proverbs 1 : 8 ; 31 : 10 , 27 , 28 . )
Still , parents who do not know the lo@@ cal language may need help to reach their chil@@ d@@ ren@@ ’s heart .
Bo@@ th children and parents benefit from associ@@ ation with the congregation ( See par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s 18 , 19 )
( b ) What must parents continue to do ?
And I enjo@@ yed the le@@ is@@ ure activities we sh@@ ared in as a group . ”
Par@@ ents , pray to Jehovah for help , and try your best .
( Read 2 Chr@@ on@@ ic@@ les 15 : 7 . )
P@@ ut your chil@@ d’s fri@@ end@@ ship with Jehovah a@@ head of your own interest@@ s .
But it wa@@ s@@ n@@ ’t until 19@@ 46 that I really under@@ sto@@ od Bible truth .
E@@ ven@@ tually , I learned si@@ gn language and had f@@ un pla@@ ying with the other children .
She accepted a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine sub@@ scrip@@ tion and wanted me to meet her husband , G@@ ary .
E@@ ven@@ tually , fi@@ ve from their clas@@ s became Jehovah’s Witnesses .
At that time , she gave me a pi@@ e@@ ce of can@@ dy and asked if we could be friends .
When she wanted to get baptized , her parents told her , “ Bec@@ ome one of Jehovah’s Witnesses , and you will have to leave our home ! ”
She continued her study and later got baptized .
When we got married in 19@@ 60 , her parents did not come to our we@@ d@@ ding .
My son N@@ ic@@ ho@@ la@@ s and his wife , De@@ bor@@ ah , serve at L@@ on@@ don Bethel

We are now part of the C@@ al@@ gar@@ y S@@ ign - L@@ angu@@ age Con@@ greg@@ ation , where I continue to serve as an elder .
How can we keep our love for Jehovah strong ?
How can we deep@@ en our love for Bible truth ?
Why is it important to have aff@@ ection for our brothers ?
What may have cau@@ sed the love of some Christians to gro@@ w co@@ ld ?
People today have less and less love for God .
S@@ how love for Jehovah ( See par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph 10 )
( Read Psalm 119 : 9@@ 7 - 10@@ 0 . )
S@@ how love for Bible truth ( See par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph 14 )
On his last night on earth , Jesus said to his disciples : “ I am giving you a new comman@@ d@@ ment , that you love one another ; just as I have loved you , you also love one another .
By this all will know that you are my disciples ​ — if you have love among y@@ ourselves . ” ​ — John 13 : 34 , 35 .
The apostle John wrote : “ The one who does not love his brother , whom he has seen , cannot love God , whom he has not seen . ”
S@@ how love for the brothers and sisters ( See par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph 17 )
What are some ways in which we can show love ?
Read 1 Th@@ ess@@ al@@ on@@ ians 4 : 9 , 10 .
“ Sim@@ on son of John , do you love me more than these ? ” ​ — J@@ O@@ H@@ N 21 : 15 .
Then he said to them : “ ‘ C@@ ast the ne@@ t on the right side of the bo@@ at and you will find some . ’
So they c@@ ast it , but they were not able to ha@@ u@@ l it in because of the large number of f@@ ish . ” ​ — John 21 : 1 - 6 .
( b ) What valu@@ able les@@ son did a brother in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and learn about his work ?
As a result , it left me al@@ most no time for spiritual matters .
“ After pl@@ ann@@ ing for about a year , ” he explained , “ I deci@@ ded to become a st@@ re@@ et v@@ end@@ or and sel@@ l ice cre@@ am .
In the beg@@ in@@ ning , I stru@@ g@@ gl@@ ed fin@@ an@@ cially and got disc@@ oura@@ ged .
I got better ac@@ qu@@ a@@ inted with my cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers ’ tas@@ tes and became more s@@ kill@@ ful in making ice cre@@ am .
A@@ c@@ tually , I was better - off fin@@ an@@ cially than when I wor@@ ked with comp@@ ut@@ ers .
It has made me happ@@ i@@ er because I do not have the st@@ ress and wor@@ ry that I had with my form@@ er jo@@ b .
And most important , I now feel clo@@ s@@ er to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Matthew 5 : 3 , 6 .
After his baptism , he said : “ The only re@@ gre@@ t I have is that I lost so much time before I reali@@ zed that serving Jehovah br@@ ings far more happiness than pursu@@ ing the en@@ ter@@ tain@@ ment offered by this world . ”
Jesus stated that “ no one can slave for two ma@@ st@@ ers . ”
He ad@@ ded : “ You cannot slave for God and for R@@ ic@@ h@@ es . ”
( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 14 . )
See the article “ Is Your R@@ ec@@ re@@ ation B@@ ene@@ fi@@ cial ? ”

“ Wh@@ ere your tre@@ asure is , there your hearts will be also . ” ​ — L@@ U@@ K@@ E 12 : 34 .
As we do so , med@@ itate on how you person@@ ally can deep@@ en your love for these spiritual tre@@ a@@ sures .
Can you ima@@ gine how precious that pe@@ ar@@ l was to him ?
( Read Mark 10 : 28 - 30 . )
( a ) Why did the apostle Paul descri@@ be our ministry as a “ tre@@ asure in ear@@ then v@@ es@@ sel@@ s ” ?
( Read Romans 1 : 14 , 15 ; 2 Timothy 4 : 2 . )
Some of them serve as Be@@ th@@ el@@ ites , pione@@ ers , and elders .
I@@ re@@ ne says , “ When I think of other go@@ als I could have pursu@@ ed , I can@@ ’t ima@@ gine one that would have brought me more joy . ”
What is the “ tre@@ asure st@@ ore ” that Jesus ref@@ er@@ red to at Matthew 13 : 5@@ 2 , and how do we fill it ?
( Read Proverbs 2 : 4 - 7 . )
Consider the experience of a brother nam@@ ed Peter .
To t@@ est Peter , the r@@ ab@@ bi asked , “ So , my bo@@ y , what language was the book of Daniel written in ? ”
When I went home and ch@@ ec@@ ked the Watchtower and A@@ wa@@ ke !
ma@@ ga@@ zin@@ es from the pre@@ vi@@ ous mon@@ ths , I found an article expla@@ ining that Daniel was written in A@@ ra@@ ma@@ ic . ”
As you do this , you will build up “ tre@@ asure in the heavens , where no th@@ i@@ ef ge@@ ts near and no mo@@ th con@@ sum@@ es .
For where your tre@@ asure is , there your hearts will be also . ” ​ — Luke 12 : 33 , 34 .

I had no ide@@ a why . ” ​ — J@@ AN@@ E@@ T .
“ I was on a three - person p@@ ho@@ ne call .

“ In our congregation , two pione@@ ers began having problems .
Their b@@ ic@@ k@@ ering was disc@@ oura@@ ging to others . ” ​ — G@@ AR@@ Y .

“ Con@@ t@@ inu@@ e p@@ ut@@ ting up with one another and for@@ giving one another fre@@ ely even if anyone has a cause for com@@ pla@@ in@@ t against another . ”
Now they get along well as they preach the good news .
That differen@@ ce may se@@ em un@@ important ; yet , it can lead to serious problems . ”
After pray@@ ing to Jehovah about the matter , I b@@ ought the sister a small gift and wrote her a car@@ d to apo@@ lo@@ gi@@ ze for my bad attitude .
We hu@@ g@@ ged each other and agre@@ ed to put the matter be@@ hin@@ d us .
We have not had any more problems . ”
F@@ O@@ R many people today , money is the bi@@ g issue .
Why must the issue of so@@ vere@@ ign@@ ty be se@@ t@@ t@@ led ?
How important is the v@@ indic@@ ation of Jehovah’s so@@ vere@@ ign@@ ty ?
Why , from the day our fore@@ fa@@ thers f@@ ell as@@ le@@ ep in death , all things are continu@@ ing ex@@ ac@@ tly as they were from cre@@ ati@@ on@@ ’s beg@@ in@@ ning . ”

How do we know that to@@ da@@ y’s comm@@ er@@ cial system was not part of God’s purpose ?
G@@ ive examples of how some are showing faith@@ fulness in their use of un@@ righteous ri@@ ches .
I am more gener@@ ous in being for@@ giving , in being pati@@ ent with others , and in being able to accept dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ments and counsel . ”
How did Abraham show that he trust@@ ed in God ?
( b ) How can we apply Paul’s counsel today ?
After call@@ ing Timothy “ a fine sol@@ di@@ er of Christ Jesus , ” Paul told him : “ No man serving as a sol@@ di@@ er invol@@ ves himself in the comm@@ er@@ cial bu@@ sin@@ ess@@ es of life , in order to gain the appro@@ val of the one who en@@ ro@@ l@@ led him as a sol@@ di@@ er . ”

If you are gri@@ ev@@ ing , you too can find so@@ o@@ thing comfort from such scrip@@ tures as the following :
( Read 1 Th@@ ess@@ al@@ on@@ ians 5 : 11 . )
What do we need to remember about gri@@ ef ?
Even when someone does expres@@ s how he feel@@ s , it is not always eas@@ y for others to understand what he is tr@@ ying to say .
At that m@@ om@@ ent , I don@@ ’t feel qu@@ ite so alone in my gri@@ ef . ”
“ Re@@ cei@@ ving a shor@@ t encoura@@ ging message or an inv@@ itation to sp@@ end time with a fellow Christian helps me more than I can say , ” says J@@ uni@@ a .
“ Those expres@@ sions make me feel loved and car@@ ed for . ”

“ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of dist@@ ress . ”
“ I exp@@ ected my first we@@ d@@ ding ann@@ i@@ ver@@ sar@@ y to be very tra@@ u@@ ma@@ tic , ” rel@@ ates one brother , “ and it was not eas@@ y .
But a few brothers and sisters pl@@ ann@@ ed a small ga@@ th@@ ering of my clo@@ s@@ est friends so that I w@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ n@@ ’t be on my own . ”
“ O@@ ften the help and compani@@ on@@ ship offered when there is no special ann@@ i@@ ver@@ sar@@ y can be very bene@@ fi@@ cial , ” expla@@ ins J@@ uni@@ a .
“ Those sp@@ on@@ tan@@ e@@ ous m@@ om@@ ents are so valu@@ able and bring much comfort . ”
They have truly made me feel Jehovah’s loving ar@@ ms around me . ”
Why are Jehovah’s promises a s@@ ource of great comfort ?
God promises that “ he will do away with death forever , and the So@@ vere@@ ign Lord Jehovah will wi@@ pe away the te@@ ars from all fa@@ ces . ”
O@@ ther scrip@@ tures that many have found comfor@@ ting are Psalm 20 : 1 , 2 ; 31 : 7 ; 38 : 8 , 9 , 15 ; 5@@ 5 : 22 ; 1@@ 21 : 1 , 2 ; Isaiah 5@@ 7 : 15 ; 6@@ 6 : 13 ; Phili@@ pp@@ ians 4 : 13 ; and 1 Peter 5 : 7 .

( b ) What can we learn from stud@@ ying Psalm 14@@ 7 ?
And there may be tr@@ illi@@ ons of g@@ ala@@ x@@ ies in the uni@@ verse !
I want you to enjoy your life as one of my Witnesses ! ”
( Read Psalm 14@@ 7 : 8 , 9 . )
12 , 13 . ( a ) To benefit from God’s help , what should we avoid ?
On the other hand , God “ hur@@ ls the wicked to the gro@@ und . ”
“ Jehovah fin@@ ds ple@@ asure in those who fear him , in those wa@@ iting for his loyal love . ”
15 - 17 . ( a ) How might we at times feel about our trials , but how does Jehovah use his Word to help us ?
Today , Jehovah guid@@ es us with his Word , the Bible .
( Read Psalm 14@@ 7 : 19 , 20 . )
What pl@@ ans can lead to a happy future for you ?
What could a life in the pioneer service lead to ?
Y@@ O@@ U young ones will pro@@ bab@@ ly agre@@ e that before star@@ ting a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , it is wise to pl@@ an where you will go .
Li@@ fe is like a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , and the time to pl@@ an where you want to go is when you are young .
How do you know that Jehovah wants you to pl@@ an for a happy future ?
Your Creator is “ the God of love , ” “ the happy God , ” who made humans “ in his ima@@ ge . ”
You will be happy when you imitate our loving God .
Jesus Christ set the perfect example for you young ones .
Jesus also dre@@ w close to Jehovah by stud@@ ying the Scriptures .
“ P@@ l@@ ans fa@@ il when there is no con@@ sul@@ tation , but there is accompl@@ ish@@ ment through many ad@@ vis@@ ers . ”
As with any care@@ er , you need time to become s@@ kill@@ ed .
At first , I cou@@ l@@ d@@ n@@ ’t star@@ t any Bible stu@@ dies , but later I moved to another ter@@ rit@@ ory , and within a mon@@ th I star@@ ted s@@ ever@@ al stu@@ dies .
One stud@@ ent began coming to the Kingdom H@@ all .
For example , Jac@@ o@@ b , from N@@ or@@ th Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a , writ@@ es : “ When I was s@@ even , many of my clas@@ s@@ mat@@ es were V@@ i@@ e@@ t@@ nam@@ ese .
I wanted to tell them about Jehovah , so after a while I made pl@@ ans to learn their language .
For the most part , I learned by com@@ par@@ ing the En@@ gl@@ ish and V@@ i@@ e@@ t@@ nam@@ ese e@@ diti@@ ons of The Watchtower .
I also made friends in a ne@@ ar@@ by V@@ i@@ e@@ t@@ nam@@ ese - language congregation .
When I was 18 , I star@@ ted pione@@ ering .
L@@ ater , I atten@@ ded the Bible S@@ cho@@ ol for S@@ ing@@ le Bro@@ thers .
This helped me with my present pioneer assign@@ ment , where I am the only elder in a V@@ i@@ e@@ t@@ nam@@ ese - language group .
Many V@@ i@@ e@@ t@@ nam@@ ese people are a@@ ma@@ zed that I have learned their language .
They inv@@ ite me in , and often I can study the Bible with them .
Some have progre@@ s@@ sed to baptism . ” ​ — Com@@ p@@ are Acts 2 : 7 , 8 .
I enjoy encoura@@ ging the young brothers in our congregation and see@@ ing their spiritual progre@@ ss .
After I atten@@ ded the Bible S@@ cho@@ ol for S@@ ing@@ le Bro@@ thers , I received a new pioneer assign@@ ment .
I@@ t@@ ’s true that I have never found anyone in the ter@@ rit@@ ory who progre@@ s@@ sed to baptism , but others have .
How may pioneer service lead to other opportun@@ ities ?
A brother nam@@ ed K@@ ev@@ in says : “ E@@ ver since I was a little bo@@ y , I have wanted to serve Jehovah full - time some@@ day .
F@@ in@@ ally , I star@@ ted pione@@ ering when I was 19 .
I supp@@ or@@ ted my@@ self working part - time for a brother who was a buil@@ der .
I learned to inst@@ all ro@@ of@@ s , w@@ in@@ do@@ ws , and do@@ ors .
L@@ ater , I sp@@ ent two years with a hur@@ ri@@ c@@ ane reli@@ ef te@@ am , re@@ building Kingdom H@@ all@@ s and ho@@ m@@ es for the brothers .
When I heard about the con@@ stru@@ ction needs in S@@ outh A@@ fri@@ c@@ a , I app@@ lied and was inv@@ ited to go .
H@@ ere in A@@ fri@@ c@@ a , I move from one Kingdom H@@ all pro@@ j@@ ect to another every few we@@ e@@ ks .
We live together , study the Bible together , and work together .
I also enjoy preaching with the lo@@ cal brothers each we@@ ek .
The pl@@ ans I made as a bo@@ y have made me happy in ways I did not fore@@ see . ”
Bethel service is a happy way of life because everything you do there is for Jehovah .
After a year and a half , I was inv@@ ited to Bethel , where I learned to op@@ er@@ ate prin@@ ting pres@@ ses and later to do comp@@ u@@ ter pro@@ gr@@ am@@ m@@ ing .
At Bethel , I enjoy hear@@ ing fir@@ s@@ th@@ and about the progre@@ ss of the disci@@ ple - making activ@@ ity worl@@ dwide .
I love serving here because what we do helps people to draw close to Jehovah . ”
You can be sure that Jehovah wants you to “ get a firm hold ” on a happy future .
( Read 1 Timothy 6 : 18 , 19 . )
Then pl@@ an to do what is pleas@@ ing to him .
He has stu@@ died human be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or since man was cre@@ ated .
I@@ t@@ ’s something you have to find out for yourself . ”
and “ Do not let them lead you into dis@@ as@@ ter ! ”
Jesus said : “ Do not fear those who k@@ ill the body and after this are not able to do anything more . ”
Do not be stru@@ ck with ter@@ ro@@ r or fear , for Jehovah your God is with you whe@@ re@@ ver you go . ”
L@@ ist@@ en to Jehovah and trust in him in all that you do .
The second article high@@ li@@ ghts how Jehovah can do the un@@ exp@@ ected by accompl@@ ish@@ ing things we could never ima@@ gine .
Like the far@@ m@@ er , we need to wa@@ it pati@@ ently .
What can we learn from the example of the prophet Mic@@ ah ?
( Read Mic@@ ah 7 : 1 - 3 . )
If we have faith like that of Mic@@ ah , we will be willing to wa@@ it for Jehovah .
So we “ endure fully with pati@@ ence and joy . ”
Abraham had to wa@@ it many years before his gran@@ d@@ sons E@@ sau and Jac@@ o@@ b were born ( See par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s 9 , 10 )
( Read Hebrews 11 : 8 - 12 . )
Although you me@@ ant to har@@ m me , God inten@@ ded it to turn out well and to pre@@ serve many people ali@@ ve , as he is doing today . ”
( b ) What helped David to wa@@ it pati@@ ently ?
( Read 2 Peter 3 : 9 . )
What will help us to be willing to wa@@ it pati@@ ently ?
What less@@ ons do we learn from what happened to the apostle Paul in Phili@@ pp@@ i ?
( Read Acts 16 : 8 - 10 . )
So@@ on after he arri@@ ved in Ma@@ ce@@ don@@ ia , he en@@ ded up in pris@@ on !
Why did Jehovah allow this to happ@@ en to Paul ?
Bo@@ th he and S@@ il@@ as star@@ ted “ pray@@ ing and pra@@ ising God with s@@ ong . ”
4 , 5 . ( a ) How could our situation be similar to that of Paul ?
( b ) How did Paul’s situation change un@@ exp@@ ec@@ te@@ dly ?
What will we now discus@@ s and re@@ view together ?
( Read 1 Peter 5 : 6 , 7 . )
S@@ ome@@ times he sur@@ pris@@ es us by doing the un@@ exp@@ ected .
Jehovah sent an ang@@ el to destro@@ y 1@@ 8@@ 5@@ ,000 of S@@ en@@ n@@ ach@@ er@@ ib@@ ’s sol@@ di@@ ers in one night .
( a ) What les@@ son do we learn from what happened to Joseph ?
No doubt Jehovah’s actions ex@@ ce@@ e@@ ded all of Jos@@ e@@ ph@@ ’s exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations .
Th@@ in@@ k , too , about Jos@@ e@@ ph@@ ’s great - gran@@ d@@ mother Sar@@ ah .
( Read Isaiah 43 : 10 - 13 . )
We know that Jehovah car@@ es for us and wants us to su@@ c@@ ce@@ ed .
How can we stri@@ p off and keep off the old person@@ ality ?
By 19@@ 39 there were 6@@ ,000 of them in the [ con@@ c@@ ent@@ r@@ ation c@@ am@@ ps ] . ”
And you people have cle@@ an@@ ed the sta@@ di@@ um so n@@ ic@@ ely .
But most of all , you are truly mul@@ ti@@ ra@@ cial . ”
But the more I had s@@ ex@@ ual rel@@ ations , the more in@@ sec@@ ure I felt . ”
This way of life continued until Sa@@ kur@@ a was 23 years old .
It got so bad that I could not wa@@ it for the woman I was living with to leave the house so that I could wat@@ ch por@@ no@@ gra@@ p@@ hi@@ c vid@@ e@@ o@@ s . ”
What helped S@@ te@@ ph@@ en to put away ang@@ er and ab@@ us@@ ive spe@@ ech ?
He says : “ Our family life im@@ proved dra@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally .
Today , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en ser@@ ves as a minist@@ eri@@ al servant , and his wife has been a reg@@ ular pioneer for s@@ ever@@ al years .
Bible t@@ ex@@ ts that encoura@@ ged me were Isaiah 5@@ 5 : 7 , which says : ‘ Let the wicked man leave his way , ’ and 1 Corinthians 6 : 11 , which says about those who had ab@@ an@@ d@@ oned sin@@ ful ways : ‘ And yet that is what some of you were . ’
For many years , Jehovah pati@@ ently helped me by means of his holy spirit to put on the new person@@ ality . ”
We also benefit from God’s Word and his holy spirit when we pre@@ p@@ are for and att@@ end congregation meetings .
Some of the nam@@ es in this article have been chan@@ ged .
See chapter 25 in the book Q@@ u@@ es@@ tions Yo@@ ung People As@@ k ​ — An@@ s@@ wers That Wor@@ k , V@@ ol@@ u@@ me 1 .

Then he atten@@ ded a meeting of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
You get to experience our worl@@ dwide bro@@ ther@@ ho@@ od and see its mirac@@ ul@@ ous unity fir@@ s@@ th@@ and . ”
When we showed them scrip@@ tures from their P@@ or@@ tu@@ gu@@ ese Bible , such as Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 or Psalm 37 : 10 , 11 , 29 , they p@@ ai@@ d attention and some@@ times even sh@@ ed te@@ ars . ”
What example did Jesus set in showing mil@@ dness and pati@@ ence ?
Then he ad@@ ded : “ If you continue showing fav@@ or@@ it@@ ism , you are comm@@ it@@ ting sin . ”
Why is it important that we clo@@ the ourselves with love ?
Lo@@ ve is also “ pati@@ ent and kind ” and “ does not get pu@@ ff@@ ed up . ”
Paul said that without love , he was “ nothing . ”
The love is in this respect , not that we have loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son as a prop@@ iti@@ at@@ ory sacrifice for our sins . ”
Jesus said : “ No one has love greater than this , that someone should sur@@ ren@@ der his life in be@@ half of his friends . ”
Let us consider how we can do so .
John wrote : “ L@@ it@@ tle children , we should love , not in word or with the ton@@ gue , but in deed and truth . ”
But then I asked my@@ self , ‘ How can I imitate Jesus in deal@@ ing with this person ? ’
After refl@@ ecting on what Jesus would have done , I deci@@ ded to let the matter go and not make an issue of it .
L@@ ater , I learned that my co@@ work@@ er had been cop@@ ing with a serious health proble@@ m and was under a lo@@ t of st@@ ress .
I concl@@ ud@@ ed that she pro@@ bab@@ ly did not really mean what she wrote .
Re@@ fl@@ ecting on Jesus ’ example of showing love even when pro@@ vo@@ ked helped me to show similar love to my co@@ work@@ er . ”
By lea@@ ving heaven , “ he emp@@ ti@@ ed himself ” in our be@@ half , even “ to the point of death . ”
P@@ E@@ A@@ C@@ E : “ P@@ ut@@ ting up with one another in love ” al@@ lo@@ ws us to enjoy “ the un@@ iting b@@ ond of peace . ”
W@@ ould you not agre@@ e that such a pe@@ a@@ ce@@ ful spirit is truly uni@@ qu@@ e in to@@ da@@ y’s divid@@ ed world ?
Paul wrote : “ Lo@@ ve buil@@ ds up . ”
The following day , they had out@@ gro@@ wn the ven@@ u@@ e . ”
B@@ el@@ o@@ w the pic@@ ture was the cap@@ tion : “ In@@ v@@ as@@ ion of the st@@ re@@ e@@ ts . ”

In what ways can parents help their children to devel@@ op self - control ?
How can you help your children to devel@@ op self - control ?
( Read Ex@@ o@@ du@@ s 34 : 5 - 7 . )
( b ) Why should you be interest@@ ed in what the Bible says about compas@@ sion ?
( a ) Why did Jehovah s@@ end angels to So@@ dom ?
( Read Ex@@ o@@ du@@ s 22 : 26 , 27 . )
We read : “ Jehovah the God of their fore@@ fa@@ thers kept war@@ ning them by means of his m@@ ess@@ en@@ g@@ ers , war@@ ning them again and again , because he felt compas@@ sion for his people and for his dw@@ ell@@ ing place . ”
“ He star@@ ted to teach them many things . ”
Instead , we need to do all we can now to help people .
One meaning of compas@@ sion is “ to suff@@ er together . ”
How can young ones and their parents show courage ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What important assign@@ ment did Solomon receive ?
To su@@ c@@ ce@@ ed , Solomon would need to be coura@@ ge@@ ous and go to work .
What could Solomon learn about courage from his father ?
( Read 1 Chr@@ on@@ ic@@ les 28 : 20 . )
How did Jesus ’ courage affect the apostles ?
Let us consider two are@@ as of life where we need courage : in our family and in the congregation .
( b ) How can young ones imitate Moses ’ example ?
He will help them provide for the needs of their fam@@ il@@ ies .
She writ@@ es : “ G@@ ro@@ wing up , I was really sh@@ y .
I could bar@@ ely talk to people at the Kingdom H@@ all , much less kno@@ ck on the do@@ ors of complete str@@ ang@@ ers . ”
With the help of her parents and others in the congregation , this young Christian ac@@ hi@@ ev@@ ed her go@@ al of becom@@ ing a reg@@ ular pioneer .
How can Psalm 37 : 25 and Hebrews 13 : 5 help parents ?
( Read Psalm 37 : 25 ; Hebrews 13 : 5 . )
A brother who has two children wrote : “ Many parents exp@@ end much effort and res@@ our@@ ces helping their children reach go@@ als in such are@@ as as sp@@ orts , rec@@ re@@ ation , and e@@ duc@@ ation .
It makes so much more sense to exp@@ end effort and res@@ our@@ ces in helping our children reach go@@ als that will help them to maintain a good standing with Jehovah .
It has been a great s@@ ource of satis@@ fa@@ ction not only to see our children reach spiritual go@@ als but to share the j@@ our@@ ne@@ y with them . ”
G@@ ive examples of courage in the Christian congregation .
( a ) How can baptized brothers be coura@@ ge@@ ous ?
( Read Phili@@ pp@@ ians 2 : 13 ; 4 : 13 . )
We ur@@ ge all baptized brothers to be coura@@ ge@@ ous and work hard for the congregation !
Therefore , “ be coura@@ ge@@ ous . . . and go to work . ”
1 , 2 . ( a ) What would life be like without the Bible ?
( Read 1 Peter 1 : 24 , 25 . )
( a ) How do langu@@ ages change over time ?

L@@ ater prin@@ tings also used the word “ L@@ O@@ R@@ D ” in cap@@ ital let@@ ters in some ver@@ ses in the Christian Greek Scriptures .
Why are we gr@@ ate@@ ful for the New World T@@ rans@@ lation ?

T@@ ake time to expla@@ in , illustr@@ ate , and apply ver@@ ses that you read
“ A tur@@ ning point came about 15 years after I was baptized .
During a talk at the Kingdom H@@ all . . . , the spe@@ ak@@ er ref@@ er@@ red to James 1 : 23 , 24 .
Those ver@@ ses li@@ ken God’s Word to a mir@@ ro@@ r in which we can see ourselves the way Jehovah se@@ es us .
I began to won@@ der if what I saw in my@@ self was different from what Jehovah saw .
At first , I res@@ ist@@ ed this new ide@@ a .
I still felt that loving me was too much to exp@@ ect of Jehovah .
“ A few days later , I read a scrip@@ ture that chan@@ ged my life .
I felt as if Jehovah were speaking to me , saying : ‘ C@@ ome on , V@@ ic@@ k@@ y , let@@ ’s set matters st@@ ra@@ ight between us .
I know you , I know your sins , I know your heart ​ — and I love you . ’
“ I was un@@ able to s@@ le@@ ep that night .
I still doub@@ ted that Jehovah could love me , but I began thinking about Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice .
All of a su@@ d@@ den , it da@@ w@@ ned on me that Jehovah had been pati@@ ent with me for so long , showing me that he loved me in so many ways .
Yet , I was , in effect , saying to him : ‘ Your love is not great en@@ ough to reach me .
Your S@@ on@@ ’s sacrifice is not en@@ ough to co@@ ver me . ’
It was as if I had been th@@ ro@@ wing the ransom back at Jehovah .
But now , at last , by med@@ it@@ ating on this gift of the ransom , I began to feel loved by Jehovah . ”

The following year , I was appointed as a special pioneer , along with Mary H@@ en@@ shall .
We were sent to un@@ assign@@ ed ter@@ rit@@ ory in the coun@@ ty of C@@ h@@ es@@ hi@@ re .
It is a great joy to know that there are now many Witnesses in that are@@ a .
My brother and his wife , Lo@@ t@@ ti@@ e , were already serving as special pione@@ ers in N@@ or@@ ther@@ n I@@ rel@@ and , and in 195@@ 2 the four of us atten@@ ded a dist@@ ri@@ ct conven@@ tion in B@@ el@@ f@@ ast .

“ Let your bro@@ ther@@ ly love continue . ” ​ — H@@ E@@ B@@ R@@ E@@ W@@ S 13 : 1 .
What is bro@@ ther@@ ly love ?
Why is it so important to continue to show bro@@ ther@@ ly love ?
Why did Paul writ@@ e a letter to the Hebrew Christians ?
IN THE year 6@@ 1 , the congregations thr@@ oughout Israel enjo@@ yed relati@@ ve peace .
Although the apostle Paul was in pris@@ on in R@@ ome , he ho@@ p@@ ed to be re@@ le@@ as@@ ed soon .
His travel@@ ing par@@ t@@ ner Timothy had just been fre@@ ed from pris@@ on , and together they ho@@ p@@ ed to vis@@ it the brothers in Ju@@ de@@ a .
E@@ ar@@ lier , Jesus had told his followers that as soon as they saw Jerusalem sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by sol@@ di@@ ers , they would need to f@@ le@@ e . ​ — Luke 21 : 20 - 24 .
It had been 28 years since Jesus gave his followers that war@@ ning .
During that time , the Christians in Israel rema@@ ined faithful des@@ pite much persecu@@ tion and many trials .
But Paul wanted to pre@@ p@@ are them for what would happ@@ en in the future .
( Read Hebrews 10 : 36 - 39 . )
So Jehovah inspired Paul to writ@@ e to those de@@ ar brothers and sisters .
That letter , now called the book of Hebrews , was des@@ ign@@ ed to strengthen them for what would happ@@ en .
Why should we be interest@@ ed in the book of Hebrews ?
As God’s people today , we should be interest@@ ed in the book of Hebrews .
But most of us enjoy pe@@ a@@ ce@@ ful circumstances and do not experience direc@@ t persecu@@ tion .
So , like the Christians in Paul’s time , we need to be al@@ er@@ t .
V@@ er@@ y soon , we will experience the bi@@ gg@@ est t@@ est of our faith ! ​ — Read Luke 21 : 34 - 36 .
What is the y@@ ear@@ t@@ ext for 20@@ 16 , and why is it appro@@ pri@@ ate ?
What will help us to pre@@ p@@ are for this future ev@@ ent ?
In the book of Hebrews , Paul stated many things that will help to strengthen our faith .
That verse has been sel@@ ected to be the y@@ ear@@ t@@ ext for 20@@ 16 .
Our y@@ ear@@ t@@ ext for 20@@ 16 : “ Let your bro@@ ther@@ ly love continue . ” ​ — Hebrews 13 : 1
How do true Christians understand the meaning of bro@@ ther@@ ly love ?
For Jews in the past , the word “ brother ” usu@@ ally ref@@ er@@ red to a relati@@ ve and some@@ times to a person ou@@ ts@@ ide the family .
But it would never incl@@ ude someone who was not Jewish .
However , as true Christians , our “ brother ” is any true Christian , no matter what coun@@ try he or she comes from .
But why is it important to continue to show bro@@ ther@@ ly love ?
( a ) What is the most important reason for us to show bro@@ ther@@ ly love ?
( b ) G@@ ive another reason why it is important to strengthen our aff@@ ection for one another .
The most important reason to show bro@@ ther@@ ly love is that Jehovah tell@@ s us to do so .
We cannot really love Jehovah if we ref@@ use to love our brothers .
Jesus had descri@@ bed how difficult that time would be .
What do we need to do now before the star@@ t of the great tribulation ?
That is where we worship Jehovah with our brothers and sisters .
But we must do more than just meet together reg@@ ularly .
( a ) What opportun@@ ities do we have to show bro@@ ther@@ ly love today ?
( b ) G@@ ive examples of how Jehovah’s people have sho@@ wn bro@@ ther@@ ly love .
Many of our brothers suff@@ er because of earth@@ qu@@ ak@@ es , f@@ loo@@ ds , hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es , ts@@ un@@ am@@ is , or other nat@@ ur@@ al dis@@ as@@ ters .
Some brothers endure persecu@@ tion .
And there are da@@ ily ec@@ on@@ om@@ ic difficul@@ ties as a result of living in this cor@@ ru@@ pt world .
Even though this world does not show love , we need to continue showing bro@@ ther@@ ly love . ​ — See end@@ no@@ te .
What will we now examin@@ e ?
After saying “ let your bro@@ ther@@ ly love continue , ” the apostle Paul list@@ ed s@@ ever@@ al ways that Christians can do this .
What does it mean to show ho@@ sp@@ it@@ ality ?
“ Do not for@@ get ho@@ sp@@ it@@ ality . ”
The word Paul used liter@@ ally means “ kindness to str@@ ang@@ ers . ”
Those two men showed kindness to vis@@ it@@ ors they did not know .
We can inv@@ ite our brothers and sisters to our home for a me@@ al or for some encoura@@ gement .
We do not need to make a bi@@ g me@@ al or sp@@ end a lo@@ t of money .
And we should not inv@@ ite only those who can re@@ pa@@ y us in some way .
What is most important is that we are never so bu@@ s@@ y that we for@@ get to show ho@@ sp@@ it@@ ality !
How can we “ keep in mind those in pris@@ on ” ?
“ Keep in mind those in pris@@ on . ”
Paul comm@@ en@@ ded the congregation because they had sho@@ wn “ sy@@ m@@ pa@@ thy for those in pris@@ on . ”
Some brothers helped Paul during the four years he was in pris@@ on , but others lived far away .
How could they help Paul ?
They could keep pray@@ ing inten@@ sel@@ y for him . ​ — Phili@@ pp@@ ians 1 : 12 - 14 ; Hebrews 13 : 18 , 19 .
Bro@@ thers and sisters who live close by can help them with practic@@ al things .
But many of us live far from those in pris@@ on .
How can we help them and not for@@ get them ?
Bro@@ ther@@ ly love will mo@@ tiv@@ ate us to pray inten@@ sel@@ y for them .
How can we honor our marriage ?
“ Let marriage be ho@@ nor@@ able among all . ”
We can also show bro@@ ther@@ ly love by being mor@@ ally clean .
Th@@ in@@ k , too , about how a wife would feel if she dis@@ co@@ vered that her husband wat@@ ches por@@ no@@ gra@@ ph@@ y .
How does cont@@ ent@@ ment help us to show bro@@ ther@@ ly love ?
Be “ cont@@ ent with the present things . ”
When we are cont@@ ent , we will remember that our Christian brothers and sisters are much more important than money or things .
We will not com@@ pla@@ in about our brothers or about our situation in life .
Instead , when we are cont@@ ent , we will be gener@@ ous . ​ — 1 Timothy 6 : 17 - 19 .
How does being “ of good courage ” help us to show bro@@ ther@@ ly love ?
Tru@@ st in Jehovah gives us the courage to endure difficult trials .
This courage helps us to have a pos@@ itive attitude .
How can we strengthen our bro@@ ther@@ ly love for our elders ?
“ Re@@ member those who are taking the lead . ”
When we think about all that they do , our love and appreciation for them gro@@ ws .
Instead , we want to obey will@@ ingly .
This way we “ give them ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ary consid@@ eration in love because of their work . ” ​ — 1 Th@@ ess@@ al@@ on@@ ians 5 : 13 .
Do you appreciate the work that elders do for us ?
How can we continue to show bro@@ ther@@ ly love in a greater way ?
Jehovah’s people are known for their bro@@ ther@@ ly love .
The same was true in Paul’s day .
C@@ learly , there is always ro@@ om for im@@ pro@@ ve@@ ment !
So as we look at our y@@ ear@@ t@@ ext in our Kingdom H@@ all during this year , let us med@@ itate on these questions : Can I be more ho@@ sp@@ it@@ able ?
What will help me to be truly cont@@ ent ?
How can I be more obedi@@ ent to those who are taking the lead ?
If we work to im@@ prove in these si@@ x are@@ as , the y@@ ear@@ t@@ ext will not be just a si@@ gn on the w@@ all ; it will re@@ mind us to obey Paul’s words : “ Let your bro@@ ther@@ ly love continue . ” ​ — Hebrews 13 : 1 .
[ 1 ] ( par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph 9 ) For examples of how Jehovah’s Witnesses show bro@@ ther@@ ly love in times of dis@@ as@@ ter , see the Ju@@ ly 15 , 200@@ 2 , Watchtower , pages 8 - 9 , and Jehovah’s Witnesses ​ — Pro@@ claim@@ ers of God’s Kingdom , chapter 19 .

What does Christ’s love mo@@ tiv@@ ate us to do ?
How does God’s love mo@@ tiv@@ ate us to love our brothers ?
Why should God’s for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess mo@@ tiv@@ ate us to for@@ give our brothers ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What does God’s “ in@@ descri@@ b@@ able free gift ” incl@@ ude ?
Paul knew that Jesus ’ sacrifice is a guar@@ an@@ te@@ e that all of God’s wonderful promises will come true .
( Read 2 Corinthians 1 : 20 . )
This means that God’s “ in@@ descri@@ b@@ able free gift ” includ@@ es Jesus ’ sacrifice and all the go@@ o@@ dness and loyal love that Jehovah shows us .
3 , 4 . ( a ) How do you feel when someone gives you a gift ?
( b ) How might a special gift change your life ?
We love it when someone gives us a gift .
But some gi@@ f@@ ts are so mean@@ ing@@ ful or special that they can change our life .
But su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , someone you do not know v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers to receive the p@@ un@@ ish@@ ment inst@@ e@@ ad of you .
He is willing to di@@ e for you !
Such a loving and special gift would cause you to make chan@@ ges in your life .
How is God’s gift of the ransom much greater than any other gift ?
God’s gift of the ransom is much greater than the gift in the example .
Lo@@ ve mo@@ tiv@@ ated Jehovah to s@@ end Jesus to the earth to di@@ e for all humans , to “ tas@@ te death for every@@ one . ”
But Jesus ’ sacrifice will do even more !
It will destro@@ y death forever .
What other blessings are includ@@ ed in Jehovah’s gift ?
( a ) What blessings of Jehovah’s gift do you look for@@ ward to ?
( b ) N@@ ame three things God’s gift will mo@@ tiv@@ ate us to do .
As part of God’s gift , the earth will become a par@@ adise , the si@@ ck will be cu@@ red , and the dead will be resurrec@@ ted .
We love Jehovah and his de@@ ar Son for giving us this “ in@@ descri@@ b@@ able free gift . ”
How should we feel about the love of Christ , and what should it mo@@ tiv@@ ate us to do ?
Paul knew that if we accept Jesus ’ great love , it will com@@ pe@@ l us , or mo@@ tiv@@ ate us , to love and honor Jesus .
Yes , when we fully understand what Jehovah has done for us , his love will mo@@ tiv@@ ate us to live in a way that shows we honor Jesus .
In turn , who@@ ever lo@@ ves me will be loved by my Father , and I will love him and will clearly show my@@ self to him . ” ​ — John 14 : 21 ; 1 John 5 : 3 .
What pres@@ sures do we have ?
During this Me@@ mor@@ ial se@@ as@@ on , it is good to med@@ itate on how we are using our life .
So ask yourself : ‘ In what are@@ as do I already imitate Jesus ?
In what are@@ as can I im@@ prove ? ’
If we are not care@@ ful , we could feel pres@@ su@@ red to star@@ t im@@ it@@ ating the worl@@ d’s teach@@ ers , c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ities , and sp@@ orts her@@ o@@ es .
What questions can we ask ourselves during this Me@@ mor@@ ial se@@ as@@ on , and what may the ans@@ wers mo@@ tiv@@ ate us to do ?
It is good to take time during the Me@@ mor@@ ial se@@ as@@ on to examin@@ e our clo@@ th@@ es , mo@@ vi@@ es , and mu@@ si@@ c , as well as what is on our comp@@ u@@ ter , c@@ ell p@@ ho@@ ne , or tab@@ let .
( Read 1 Timothy 2 : 9 , 10 . )
W@@ ould Jesus like to wat@@ ch my mo@@ vi@@ es ?
If Jesus bor@@ ro@@ wed my c@@ ell p@@ ho@@ ne or tab@@ let , would I be em@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ sed by what he saw ?
( a ) How does our love for Jehovah and Jesus mo@@ tiv@@ ate us in the preaching work ?
( b ) How can our love mo@@ tiv@@ ate us to help others in the congregation ?
Our love for Jesus mo@@ tiv@@ ates us to preach and teach with ze@@ al .
During the Me@@ mor@@ ial se@@ as@@ on , can you ar@@ ran@@ ge your da@@ ily life so that you can au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary pioneer and sp@@ end 30 or 50 ho@@ ur@@ s in the preaching work ?
But the pione@@ ers in his are@@ a wanted to help him .
Can you help someone in your congregation to au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary pioneer in Mar@@ ch or A@@ pri@@ l ?
If we do so , we will show that we , like Paul , are mo@@ tiv@@ ated by Jesus ’ love .
What el@@ se will God’s love move us to do ?
The apostle John wrote : “ B@@ el@@ o@@ ved ones , if this is how God loved us , then we are also under ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation to love one another . ”
So if we accept God’s love , we need to love our brothers .
What example did Jesus set in loving others ?
Jesus ’ example shows us how we can love others .
When he was on earth , he helped people , especially the humble ones .
He loved those humble people and wor@@ ked hard to help them . ​ — Matthew 20 : 28 .
Can you help an older brother or sister in the ministry ?
( See par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph 14 )
What can you do to show love for your brothers ?
( Read Luke 14 : 12 - 14 . )
Let God’s love mo@@ tiv@@ ate you to show love for your brothers !
What must we recogni@@ ze ?
T@@ hir@@ d , Jehovah’s love mo@@ tiv@@ ates us to for@@ give our brothers and sisters .
All of us have inher@@ ited sin and death from Adam , so no one can say , “ I do not need the ransom . ”
Even the most faithful servant of God needs the gift of the ransom .
E@@ ach of us has been for@@ given a hu@@ ge de@@ b@@ t !
We find the answer in one of Jesus ’ illustr@@ ations .
16 , 17 . ( a ) What should we learn from Jesus ’ illustration of the king and the sla@@ ves ?
( b ) After med@@ it@@ ating on Jesus ’ illustration , what are you determined to do ?
But later , that slave did not for@@ give a fellow slave a much smal@@ l@@ er de@@ b@@ t of only 10@@ 0 den@@ ari@@ i .
The k@@ ing@@ ’s mercy should have mo@@ tiv@@ ated his slave to for@@ give a fellow slave .
The king was fur@@ ious when he heard that his slave did not for@@ give such a small de@@ b@@ t .
S@@ ho@@ uld you not also have sho@@ wn mercy to your fellow slave as I showed mercy to you ? ”
Like the king , Jehovah has for@@ given us a hu@@ ge de@@ b@@ t .
What should Jehovah’s love and mercy mo@@ tiv@@ ate us to do ?
As we pre@@ p@@ are for the Me@@ mor@@ ial , we might ask ourselves : ‘ Have I been hur@@ t by a brother ?
Do I find it difficult to for@@ give him ? ’
If so , this is a good time to imitate Jehovah , who is “ ready to for@@ give . ”
If we do not love and for@@ give our brothers , we cannot exp@@ ect Jehovah to love and for@@ give us .
When we for@@ give others , it does not change the fact that they hur@@ t us , but it will help us to have a happ@@ i@@ er future .
How did God’s love help one sister to put up with the im@@ perf@@ ec@@ tions of another sister ?
It can be difficult to put up with the im@@ perf@@ ec@@ tions of our brothers and sisters .
Even though helping C@@ ar@@ ol was difficult for L@@ ily , she says : “ I look for@@ ward to see@@ ing C@@ ar@@ ol in the resurrection .
I want to know her when she is perfect . ”
How will God’s “ in@@ descri@@ b@@ able free gift ” mo@@ tiv@@ ate you ?
Jehovah has truly given us an “ in@@ descri@@ b@@ able free gift . ”
May their love mo@@ tiv@@ ate us to imitate Jesus clo@@ sel@@ y , to show love for our brothers , and to for@@ give our brothers from the heart .

What events made P@@ ent@@ ec@@ ost a special day , and how did those events ful@@ fill what the Scriptures had foretold ?
Then , at about n@@ ine o@@ ’@@ clo@@ ck , he offered two le@@ av@@ ened lo@@ a@@ ves made from the first whe@@ at , or the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its , of the har@@ v@@ est .
The high pri@@ est wa@@ ved the lo@@ a@@ ves from side to side to present them to Jehovah .
This was P@@ ent@@ ec@@ ost of the year 33 . ​ — Lev@@ it@@ ic@@ us 23 : 15 - 20 .
E@@ very year , for h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of years , the high pri@@ est made this wa@@ ve off@@ ering .
The off@@ ering was clo@@ sel@@ y rel@@ ated to something very important that happened on P@@ ent@@ ec@@ ost of the year 33 .
And it happened to 1@@ 20 disciples of Jesus who were pray@@ ing together in an u@@ pp@@ er ro@@ om in Jerusalem .
E@@ ight h@@ und@@ red years ear@@ lier , the prophet Jo@@ el had written about this ev@@ ent .
Read Acts 2 : 2 - 4 .
On P@@ ent@@ ec@@ ost of the year 33 , God gave those Christians his holy spirit , and they were anointed .
Then , he told the crowd : “ Re@@ p@@ ent , and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess of your sins , and you will receive the free gift of the holy spirit . ”
( a ) Why should we be interest@@ ed in what happened at P@@ ent@@ ec@@ ost ?
( b ) What other important ev@@ ent may have happened on the same day many years ear@@ lier ?
What did the high pri@@ est and the off@@ ering he made every P@@ ent@@ ec@@ ost re@@ present ?
The high pri@@ est repres@@ ented Jesus .
Those disciples have been cho@@ s@@ en from among sin@@ ful humans and are called “ fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its . ”
God has accepted these ones as his sons and has cho@@ s@@ en them to rule as k@@ ings with Jesus in heaven as part of God’s Kingdom .
How do we know that not all those who are anointed receive their ano@@ in@@ ting in ex@@ ac@@ tly the same way ?
E@@ ach of them had what loo@@ ked like a fl@@ ame on his head .
Jehovah gave them the ability to speak in a fore@@ ign language .
They had no doubt that they were anointed by holy spirit .
For example , the Bible does not say that something that loo@@ ked like a fl@@ ame appe@@ ared on the head@@ s of the thou@@ san@@ ds in Jerusalem who were anointed later that day .
The Sam@@ ar@@ it@@ ans were anointed some@@ time after their baptism .
And in an unu@@ su@@ al case , C@@ or@@ n@@ eli@@ us and those in his house were anointed before they were baptized . ​ — Acts 10 : 44 - 48 .
What do all anointed ones receive , and how does this affect them ?
C@@ learly , Christians reali@@ ze in different ways that they are anointed .
Some may have reali@@ zed right away that Jehovah anointed them .
So Jehovah uses his holy spirit to make it ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely clear to these Christians that he has cho@@ s@@ en them to go to heaven .
What must each anointed Christian do to receive his re@@ ward in heaven ?
Peter explained it this way : “ Therefore , brothers , be all the more d@@ il@@ ig@@ ent to make your call@@ ing and cho@@ os@@ ing sure for y@@ ourselves , for if you keep on doing these things , you will by no means ever fa@@ il . In fact , in this way you will be ri@@ ch@@ ly gran@@ ted ent@@ r@@ ance into the everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Sa@@ vi@@ or Jesus Christ . ”
So each anointed Christian must not let anything sto@@ p him from serving Jehovah .
Even though he has been inv@@ ited , or called , to go to heaven , if he does not sta@@ y faithful , he will not get his re@@ ward . ​ — Hebrews 3 : 1 ; Revelation 2 : 10 .
8 , 9 . ( a ) Why is it difficult for most people to understand what happ@@ ens when someone is anointed ?
( b ) How does a person know that he has been inv@@ ited to go to heaven ?
M@@ ost of God’s servants today may find it difficult to understand what happ@@ ens to someone when God ano@@ in@@ ts him .
So when he ano@@ in@@ ts them , their hope and the way they think change , so that they look for@@ ward to life in heaven . ​ — Read E@@ ph@@ es@@ ians 1 : 18 .
No@@ tice what Paul said to the anointed brothers in R@@ ome , who were “ called to be holy ones . ”
He told them : “ You did not receive a spirit of sla@@ very cau@@ sing fear again , but you received a spirit of ad@@ op@@ tion as sons , by which spirit we c@@ ry out : ‘ Ab@@ ba , Father ! ’
By means of his holy spirit , God makes it clear to someone that he or she is inv@@ ited to rule as a king in heaven with Jesus . ​ — 1 Th@@ ess@@ al@@ on@@ ians 2 : 12 .
What does 1 John 2 : 27 mean when it says that an anointed Christian does not need someone el@@ se to teach him ?
Those who receive this inv@@ itation from God do not need anyone el@@ se to tell them that they have been anointed .
Jehovah makes them feel con@@ vin@@ ced .
The apostle John tell@@ s anointed Christians : “ You have an ano@@ in@@ ting from the holy one , and all of you have knowledge . ”
Just as it has taught you , remain in un@@ ion with him . ”
A@@ no@@ inted Christians need to be taught by Jehovah just like every@@ one el@@ se .
But they do not need anyone to con@@ firm that they are anointed .
Jehovah has used the most powerful for@@ ce , his holy spirit , to make it ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely clear to them that they are !
What might an anointed Christian won@@ der , but what does he never doubt ?
When Christians are anointed by holy spirit , they change very much .
The w@@ in@@ d b@@ lo@@ ws where it wants to , and you hear the so@@ und of it , but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going . So it is with every@@ one who has been born from the spirit . ”
S@@ ome@@ one who has been anointed does not doubt that Jehovah has cho@@ s@@ en him
He may even won@@ der if he is good en@@ ough for this responsibility .
But he does not doubt that Jehovah has cho@@ s@@ en him .
Instead , he feel@@ s ex@@ tre@@ m@@ ely happy and is very gr@@ ate@@ ful for such a gift .
How does the way a person thin@@ ks change when he is anointed by holy spirit , and what cau@@ ses this change ?
Did they change because they felt de@@ pres@@ sed or suff@@ ered a lo@@ t ?
O@@ r did they want to experience what it would be like to live in heaven ?
How do anointed ones feel about their life here on earth ?
So does this mean that anointed ones want to di@@ e ?
These Christians do not want to di@@ e .
They enjoy life and want to use each day to serve Jehovah with their family and friends .
But no matter what they are doing , they remember what God has promised them for the future . ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 5@@ 3 ; 2 Peter 1 : 4 ; 1 John 3 : 2 , 3 ; Revelation 20 : 6 .
What does not prove that a person has been anointed by holy spirit ?
If you feel that he might have , think about these important questions : Do you feel that you are especially ze@@ al@@ ous in the preaching work ?
Do you really enjoy stud@@ ying the Bible and lear@@ ning “ the deep things of God ” ?
Do you feel that Jehovah has given you wonderful resul@@ ts in the preaching work ?
Do you have deep love for others and feel a great responsibility to help them serve Jehovah ?
Have you seen pro@@ of that Jehovah has helped you in many speci@@ fi@@ c ways in your life ?
In fact , if you are wonder@@ ing whether you will go to heaven , it means that you have not been inv@@ ited .
How do we know that not all those who have received God’s spirit have been inv@@ ited to go to heaven ?
Jesus said that there was no man greater than John , but then he said that John would not rule as a king in heaven .
David too was guid@@ ed by holy spirit .
Ho@@ ly spirit helped him to understand deep things about Jehovah and also direc@@ ted him to writ@@ e par@@ ts of the Bible .
Even so , the apostle Peter said that David “ did not as@@ c@@ end to the heavens . ”
It simply means that Jehovah will bring them back to life in Par@@ adise on earth . ​ — John 5 : 28 , 29 ; Acts 24 : 15 .
17 , 18 . ( a ) What re@@ ward do most of God’s servants look for@@ ward to today ?
Like Abraham , David , John the B@@ ap@@ t@@ ist , and many other men and women in Bible times , they look for@@ ward to living on earth when God’s govern@@ ment will rule over them .
There will be 14@@ 4@@ ,000 rul@@ ing with Jesus in heaven .
But the Bible spe@@ ak@@ s of “ the rema@@ ining ones ” of the anointed who are still on earth in this time of the end .
If someone in your congregation star@@ ts to e@@ at the b@@ read and d@@ rin@@ k the w@@ ine at the Me@@ mor@@ ial , how should you tre@@ at him ?
We will answer these questions in the next article .
[ 1 ] ( par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph 4 ) The F@@ es@@ tiv@@ al of P@@ ent@@ ec@@ ost was pos@@ sib@@ ly c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ated at the same time of the year that the Law was given to Moses at Sin@@ ai .
So perhaps Moses brought the nation of Israel into the Law covenant on the same day of the year that Jesus brought anointed ones into the new covenant .

How is Z@@ ec@@ har@@ iah 8 : 23 being fulfilled ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What did Jehovah say would happ@@ en in our time ?
( b ) What questions will be ans@@ we@@ red in this article ?
The “ Je@@ w ” repres@@ ents those whom God has anointed by holy spirit .
They are also called “ the Israel of God . ”
But Jesus said that they would all be “ one flo@@ ck ” and would follow him , their “ one shepher@@ d . ”
( 3 ) If someone in my congregation star@@ ts to e@@ at the b@@ read and d@@ rin@@ k the w@@ ine at the Me@@ mor@@ ial , how should I tre@@ at him ?
( 4 ) Do I need to wor@@ ry when I see the number of those who e@@ at the b@@ read and d@@ rin@@ k the w@@ ine at the Me@@ mor@@ ial going up ?
Why is it not possible for us to know for sure who will be part of the 14@@ 4@@ ,000 ?
Because it is not possible for anyone to know for sure that these ones will get their re@@ ward .
Jehovah gives this fin@@ al appro@@ val , or fin@@ al se@@ al@@ ing , e@@ ither before they di@@ e or just before the star@@ t of “ the great tribulation . ” ​ — Revelation 2 : 10 ; 7 : 3 , 14 .
The Bible verse men@@ tions one Je@@ w .
What war@@ ning should anointed ones think ser@@ i@@ ously about , and why ?
A@@ no@@ inted ones should think ser@@ i@@ ously about the war@@ ning found at 1 Corinthians 11 : 27 - 29 .
How might an anointed one e@@ at the b@@ read and d@@ rin@@ k the w@@ ine “ un@@ wor@@ th@@ ily ” at the Me@@ mor@@ ial ?
This strong war@@ ning remin@@ ds anointed ones that they must sta@@ y faithful if they want to receive “ the pri@@ ze of the up@@ ward call of God by means of Christ Jesus . ” ​ — Phili@@ pp@@ ians 3 : 13 - 16 .
How should they do this ?
Jehovah’s holy spirit helps his servants to be humble , not p@@ r@@ ou@@ d .
So anointed ones do not think that they are better than others .
And they do not feel that they can understand Bible tru@@ ths more deep@@ ly than anyone el@@ se .
What do anointed Christians not exp@@ ect , and why ?
Although anointed ones feel that it is an honor to be inv@@ ited to go to heaven , they do not exp@@ ect others to tre@@ at them in a special way .
A@@ no@@ inted Christians do not feel that they should sp@@ end time only with other anointed ones , as if they were members of a cl@@ u@@ b .
They do not try to find other anointed ones so that they can talk about being anointed or meet in grou@@ ps to study the Bible .
The congregation would not be un@@ ited if anointed ones did this .
Why do you need to be care@@ ful about the way you tre@@ at those who e@@ at the b@@ read and d@@ rin@@ k the w@@ ine at the Me@@ mor@@ ial ?
( See the bo@@ x “ Lo@@ ve ‘ Does Not Be@@ have In@@ dec@@ ently . ’ ” )
How should you tre@@ at anointed brothers and sisters ?
Jesus told his disciples : “ All of you are brothers . ”
He continued : “ W@@ ho@@ ever ex@@ al@@ ts himself will be hum@@ bl@@ ed , and who@@ ever hum@@ bl@@ es himself will be ex@@ al@@ ted . ”
So it would be wrong to ad@@ m@@ ire a person too much , even if he is an anointed brother of Christ .
But this is because they “ pres@@ ide in a fine way ” and “ work hard in speaking and teaching , ” not because they are anointed .
How should you tre@@ at someone who e@@ at@@ s the b@@ read and d@@ rin@@ ks the w@@ ine at the Me@@ mor@@ ial ?
( See par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s 9 - 11 )
How can you show that you respect anointed Christians ?
How can we show that we respect those who are anointed by Jehovah ?
We would not ask them how they became anointed .
And we should not think that their husband or wife , their parents , or other family members are also anointed .
A person does not inher@@ it his hope from his family .
We should also avoid ask@@ ing questions that could hur@@ t others .
After all , we can be ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely sure that in the new world , Jehovah will “ satis@@ fy the desire of every living thing . ” ​ — Psalm 1@@ 45 : 16 .
How do we prot@@ ect ourselves if we avoid “ ad@@ mir@@ ing person@@ alities ” ?
If we do not tre@@ at anointed ones as more important than others , we also prot@@ ect ourselves .
But if we avoid “ ad@@ mir@@ ing person@@ alities , ” we will never follow others , even those who are anointed or well - known or those who have served Jehovah for a long time .
Then , if they become un@@ faithful or leave the congregation , we will not lo@@ se our faith in Jehovah or sto@@ p serving him . ​ — J@@ ude 16 , fo@@ o@@ t@@ no@@ te .
Why should we not wor@@ ry about the number of those who e@@ at the b@@ read and d@@ rin@@ k the w@@ ine at the Me@@ mor@@ ial ?
For many years , the number of those who ate the b@@ read and d@@ ran@@ k the w@@ ine at the Me@@ mor@@ ial kept going down .
But rec@@ ently , that number has been going up every year .
“ Jehovah kno@@ ws those who bel@@ ong to him . ”
So the number includ@@ es those who think that they are anointed but are not .
O@@ thers may have men@@ tal or emo@@ ti@@ onal problems and believe that they will rule with Christ in heaven .
C@@ learly , we do not know ex@@ ac@@ tly how many anointed ones are left on earth .
What does the Bible say about the number of anointed ones who will be on earth when the great tribulation star@@ ts ?
There will be anointed ones in many par@@ ts of the earth when Jesus comes to take them to heaven .
The Bible says that Jesus “ will s@@ end out his angels with a great tru@@ m@@ pe@@ t so@@ und , and they will ga@@ ther his cho@@ s@@ en ones together from the four w@@ in@@ ds , from one ex@@ tre@@ m@@ ity of the heavens to their other ex@@ tre@@ m@@ ity . ”
The Bible also shows that during the last days , there will be a small number of anointed ones left on earth .
But it does not say how many of them will be left when the great tribulation beg@@ ins .
What do we need to understand about the 14@@ 4@@ ,000 cho@@ s@@ en by Jehovah ?
For h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of years after that , most of those who said that they were Christians did not really follow Christ .
Even so , during those years , Jehovah anointed those few who were true Christians .
They were like the whe@@ at that Jesus said would gro@@ w among the we@@ eds .
During the last days , Jehovah has continued to cho@@ ose people who will be part of the 14@@ 4@@ ,000 .
So if God deci@@ d@@ es to cho@@ ose some of these just before the end , su@@ rely we would not doubt that he is doing the right thing .
On@@ ly a few anointed Christians in the first century were used to writ@@ e the Christian Greek Scriptures .
And today , only a few anointed Christians have the responsibility to give God’s people “ food at the proper time . ”
All must sta@@ y humble .
All must serve him together and be un@@ ited .
[ 2 ] ( par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph 15 ) Although Acts 2 : 33 shows that Jesus is involved when someone is anointed , Jehovah is the one who inv@@ ites that person .
Instead , when we love our brothers , we think about their feelings before we say or do something .
We can show that we love those taking the lead in Jehovah’s organization by the way we tre@@ at them .
At times , well - known brothers might vis@@ it our congregation or the conven@@ tion we att@@ end .
N@@ at@@ ur@@ ally , we want to show them and their wi@@ ves respect , and this is good .
But even if we w@@ el@@ come these brothers , could it be that we are still not showing them respect ?
Although we enjoy meeting and tal@@ king with the brothers and sisters who vis@@ it us , we would not show them respect if we tre@@ ated them as c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ities .
For example , would it show good man@@ n@@ ers if we take p@@ ho@@ to@@ s of them without their per@@ mis@@ sion or when they are not aw@@ are of it , perhaps when they are e@@ ating or doing something el@@ se ?
W@@ ould we p@@ us@@ h in f@@ ron@@ t of others and in@@ s@@ ist that we have a p@@ ho@@ to taken with them ?
What effect could such be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or have on those atten@@ ding one of our conven@@ tions for the first time ?
Instead , we show them respect because we understand why they are vis@@ iting us and how hard they work for us .
What will help us to know how to tre@@ at our brothers ?
First , remember that we should give glory to Jehovah .
S@@ ec@@ ond , reali@@ ze that while it is good to respect these brothers and their wi@@ ves , we would not want to tre@@ at them as c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ities .
They want to be tre@@ ated as our brothers and sisters .
If we remember these things , we will show love and “ not be@@ have in@@ dec@@ ently . ”
The ten men “ go with ” the Je@@ w : The other sheep serve Jehovah with anointed ones but do not think of them as their lead@@ ers or give them too much praise and attention .
Instead , the other sheep love and respect anointed ones and tre@@ at them as their brothers and sisters
“ Wor@@ king together with him , we also ur@@ ge you not to accept the un@@ deser@@ ved kindness of God and mis@@ s its purpose . ” ​ — 2 C@@ O@@ R@@ IN@@ TH@@ I@@ AN@@ S 6 : 1 .
br@@ ings us happiness ?
dra@@ ws us clo@@ s@@ er to God and to others ?
Even though Jehovah is the Su@@ pre@@ me One , what has he inv@@ ited others to do ?
J@@ E@@ HO@@ V@@ A@@ H is the Su@@ pre@@ me One .
He cre@@ ated everything , and he has un@@ lim@@ ited wisdom and power .
After he helped Job understand this , Job said to him : “ I know that you are able to do all things and that nothing you have in mind to do is im@@ possible for you . ”
Jehovah can do w@@ hatever he deci@@ d@@ es to do without help from anyone .
But he shows love by inv@@ iting others to work together with him to accompl@@ ish his purpose .
What important work did Jehovah inv@@ ite Jesus to do ?
Then , Jehovah allow@@ ed his Son to help him cre@@ ate all other things .
What did Jehovah inv@@ ite Adam to do , and why ?
Jehovah also inv@@ ited humans to work together with him .
For example , he allow@@ ed Adam to name the an@@ ima@@ ls .
I@@ mag@@ ine the joy Adam felt doing this work !
He care@@ fully stu@@ died the way the an@@ ima@@ ls loo@@ ked and ac@@ ted , and then he cho@@ se a name for each one of them .
How did others work with God to accompl@@ ish his will ?
L@@ ater , God inv@@ ited other people to work with him .
Noah buil@@ t an ar@@ k that kept him and his family ali@@ ve during the F@@ lood .
Moses fre@@ ed the nation of Israel from Egypt .
Joshua led the Israelites into the Pro@@ mis@@ ed L@@ and .
Solomon buil@@ t the temple in Jerusalem .
All these faithful ones and many others wor@@ ked with Jehovah to accompl@@ ish his will .
In what work can we share , and did Jehovah need to invol@@ ve us in this work ?
Today , Jehovah inv@@ ites us to do all we can to support his Kingdom .
There are many ways we can serve God .
He could have spo@@ ken direc@@ tly from heaven to people on earth .
The apostle Paul wrote : “ Wor@@ king together with him , we also ur@@ ge you not to accept the un@@ deser@@ ved kindness of God and mis@@ s its purpose . ”
It is a great honor to be inv@@ ited to work with God .
Let us see some reasons why this br@@ ings us great joy .
How did God’s fir@@ st@@ born Son descri@@ be how he felt about working b@@ es@@ ide his Father ?
Wor@@ king with God has always made Jehovah’s servants happy .
When Jesus wor@@ ked with his Father , he was happy because he accompl@@ ished many things and he knew that Jehovah loved him .
Why does the preaching work bring us joy ?
Jesus said that we are happy both when we give and when we receive .
It brought us joy when we received the truth , but why does it also bring us joy to share the truth with others ?
The preaching work is the most important and the most satis@@ f@@ ying work we could be doing .
It makes it possible for those who become God’s friends to have everlasting life . ​ — 2 Corinthians 5 : 20 .
What have some said about the joy of working with Jehovah ?
This also gives us joy .
Mar@@ c@@ o , who lives in I@@ tal@@ y , says : “ I have the pri@@ c@@ eless joy of know@@ ing that I am giving my best to Jehovah and not to someone who will soon for@@ get what I@@ ’@@ ve done . ”
Sim@@ il@@ arly , F@@ ran@@ c@@ o , who also ser@@ ves in I@@ tal@@ y , says : “ By means of his Word and his spiritual pro@@ vis@@ ions , Jehovah remin@@ ds us every day that he lo@@ ves us and that everything we do for him is important , even though our efforts may se@@ em like nothing to us .
This is why working along with God makes me happy and gives my life meaning . ”
What relationship exist@@ ed between Jehovah and Jesus , and why ?
Jesus wor@@ ked with Jehovah for perhaps b@@ illi@@ ons of years .
Jesus explained how close that relationship was when he said : “ I and the Father are one . ”
They were truly un@@ ited , and they fully co@@ op@@ er@@ ated when they wor@@ ked together .
Why does preaching draw us clo@@ s@@ er to God and to others ?
He pray@@ ed : “ So that they may be one just as we are one . ”
We learn why it is wise to trust in him and to follow his direction .
And when we draw close to God , he dra@@ ws close to us .
( Read James 4 : 8 . )
We also draw close to our brothers and sisters because we experience similar problems and jo@@ ys and because we have the same go@@ als .
We work together , rejo@@ ice together , and endure together .
O@@ c@@ ta@@ vi@@ a , who lives in B@@ rit@@ a@@ in , says : “ Wor@@ king with Jehovah dra@@ ws me clo@@ s@@ er to others . ”
She expla@@ ins that it is because her fri@@ end@@ shi@@ ps are now based on “ a comm@@ on go@@ al and direction . ”
Su@@ rely , we feel the same way .
When we see the efforts our brothers make to please Jehovah , it dra@@ ws us clo@@ s@@ er to them .
Why will we draw even clo@@ s@@ er to Jehovah and to our brothers in the new world ?
Our love for God and our brothers is strong now , but it will be even str@@ ong@@ er in the new world .
Th@@ in@@ k of all the exc@@ iting work we will do in the future !
We will also work to make the earth into a par@@ adise .
All humans will draw even clo@@ s@@ er to one another and to Jehovah , who will su@@ rely “ satis@@ fy the desire of every living thing . ” ​ — Psalm 1@@ 45 : 16 .
We need to prot@@ ect our relationship with Jehovah .
So we must use all our strength to s@@ wi@@ m in the other direction .
Sim@@ il@@ arly , we need to work hard to avoid being influ@@ enc@@ ed by Satan’s world .
So how does preaching prot@@ ect us ?
When we talk about Jehovah and the Bible , we foc@@ us on things that are important and good , not on things that will weak@@ en our faith .
How does one W@@ itness in A@@ ustr@@ ali@@ a feel about preaching ?
When we keep bu@@ s@@ y preaching , stud@@ ying , and doing things for others in the congregation , we are prot@@ ected because we do not have time to wor@@ ry too much about our own problems .
The preaching work helps me to try to sta@@ y humble ; it gives me an opportunity to rely on Jehovah and on my brothers and sisters . ”
Why does our pers@@ ever@@ ance in preaching show that God’s spirit is with us ?
P@@ re@@ aching also gives us more confidence that God’s spirit is with us .
To illustr@@ ate : I@@ mag@@ ine that it is your jo@@ b to give b@@ read to the people in your commun@@ ity .
You do not get p@@ ai@@ d to do this , and you have to pa@@ y for your exp@@ en@@ ses .
Al@@ so , most people do not want the b@@ read , and some even ha@@ te you for br@@ ing@@ ing it to them .
How long would you continue to work at such a jo@@ b ?
Yet , many of us continue in the preaching work year after year , even though this co@@ st@@ s us time and money and even though people make f@@ un of us or get ang@@ ry with us .
This pro@@ ves that God’s spirit is helping us .
How is the preaching of the good news con@@ n@@ ected with God’s purpose for human@@ kind ?
God’s purpose was that humans live forever , and his purpose did not change when Adam sin@@ ned .
God made an arrang@@ ement for us to be fre@@ ed from sin and death .
Jesus came to earth and sacrific@@ ed his life .
When we preach and help others to become God’s friends today , we are working direc@@ tly with God in his loving arrang@@ ement to sa@@ ve humans from sin and death .
How is our preaching l@@ in@@ ked to God’s great@@ est comman@@ d@@ ments ?
When we help others find the way to everlasting life , we show that we love them and we love Jehovah .
His “ will is that all s@@ orts of people should be sa@@ ved and come to an acc@@ ur@@ ate knowledge of truth . ”
When a Phar@@ is@@ e@@ e asked Jesus what was God’s great@@ est comman@@ d@@ ment , Jesus said : “ ‘ You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind . ’
How do you feel about the honor to preach the good news ?
It also gives us the opportunity to show our love for God and for others .
Jehovah has milli@@ ons of servants around the world , and all of them have very different circumstances .
I give you my strength , my Word the Bible , heavenly support , earthly compani@@ ons , progre@@ s@@ sive tra@@ ining , and pre@@ c@@ ise instru@@ c@@ tions at the appro@@ pri@@ ate time . ’
What an im@@ men@@ se privilege it is to do what Jehovah ask@@ s of us and to work together with our God ! ”
We are working together with God when we preach to others and help them to become his friends so that they can live forever .
Even though God could do this work by himself , he shows us love by inv@@ iting us to work with him .
In the first article , we will learn from the example of Abraham .
In the second , we will learn from the examples of Ruth , He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , and Jesus ’ mother , Mary .
In these ar@@ ti@@ cles , we will discus@@ s some Bible accoun@@ ts about King David and others who lived in his time .
By consid@@ ering their examples , we will learn how we can sta@@ y loyal to Jehovah even in difficult situ@@ ations .
26 Li@@ fe St@@ ory ​ — Jehovah H@@ as G@@ i@@ ven Me Su@@ cc@@ ess in His Ser@@ vice
30 Keep On Ser@@ ving Jehovah With Jo@@ y
I told the off@@ ic@@ er that I had already been in pris@@ on because I would not fi@@ ght .
I asked him , “ Are you going to make me go through that again ? ”
I WA@@ S born in 19@@ 26 in C@@ ro@@ o@@ k@@ s@@ v@@ il@@ le , O@@ hi@@ o , in the Un@@ ited St@@ ates .
Father and M@@ other were not religious , but they told us e@@ ight children to go to ch@@ ur@@ ch .
I went to the Me@@ tho@@ dis@@ t C@@ hur@@ ch .
When I was 14 , the minist@@ er gave me a pri@@ ze because I went to ch@@ ur@@ ch every S@@ un@@ day for a year .
Mar@@ gar@@ et W@@ al@@ k@@ er ( second sister from the left ) helped me learn the truth
Ab@@ out that time , a neighb@@ or nam@@ ed Mar@@ gar@@ et W@@ al@@ k@@ er , one of Jehovah’s Witnesses , began vis@@ iting my mother and tal@@ king to her about the Bible .
M@@ other thought that I would inter@@ f@@ ere with her study , so she told me to get out of the house .
But I kept tr@@ ying to listen to their discus@@ sions .
After a couple more vis@@ its , Mar@@ gar@@ et asked me , “ Do you know what God’s name is ? ”
I said , “ E@@ ver@@ y@@ one kno@@ ws that ​ — it@@ ’s God . ”
She said , “ G@@ et your Bible and look up Psalm 8@@ 3 : 18 . ”
I did , and I dis@@ co@@ vered that God’s name is Jehovah .
I r@@ an out to my friends and told them , “ When you get home ton@@ ight , look up Psalm 8@@ 3 : 18 in the Bible and see what God’s name is . ”
You might say I star@@ ted w@@ itness@@ ing right away .
I stu@@ died the Bible and got baptized in 19@@ 41 .
So@@ on af@@ ter@@ ward , I was assign@@ ed to conduct a congregation book study .
I encoura@@ ged my mother and si@@ bl@@ ings to come , and they all began atten@@ ding the book study that I condu@@ cted .
D@@ ad , though , was not interest@@ ed .
I was given more responsibility in the congregation , and I col@@ l@@ ected many bo@@ o@@ ks publ@@ ished by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
One day , D@@ ad pointed to my bo@@ o@@ ks and said : “ You see all that stu@@ f@@ f ?
I want it out of this house , and you can go with it . ”
S@@ ome@@ times when she was on her way , he cha@@ sed after her and p@@ ul@@ led her back into the house .
But she would just ru@@ n out the other do@@ or and go to the meeting .
I told M@@ other : “ D@@ on@@ ’t wor@@ ry .
He@@ ’@@ ll get ti@@ red of run@@ ning after you . ”
I repor@@ ted to F@@ ort H@@ ay@@ es in C@@ ol@@ um@@ bu@@ s , O@@ hi@@ o , had a physical examin@@ ation , and fill@@ ed out p@@ ap@@ er@@ work .
I also told the off@@ i@@ ci@@ als that I would not become a sol@@ di@@ er .
But a few days later , an off@@ ic@@ er came to my do@@ or and told me , “ C@@ or@@ w@@ in Ro@@ bis@@ on , I have a war@@ ran@@ t for your ar@@ rest . ”
In cour@@ t two we@@ e@@ ks later , the jud@@ ge said : “ If it were up to me , I@@ ’@@ d give you a life s@@ ent@@ ence .
Do you have anything to say ? ”
I rep@@ lied : “ Your H@@ on@@ or , I should have been clas@@ si@@ fied as a minist@@ er .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one@@ ’s do@@ or@@ st@@ ep is my p@@ ul@@ p@@ it , and I have pre@@ ached the good news of the Kingdom to many people . ”
The jud@@ ge told the j@@ ur@@ y : “ You are not here to deci@@ de whether this young man is a minist@@ er or not .
You are here to deci@@ de whether he repor@@ ted for in@@ du@@ ction into the ar@@ my or not . ”
In less than half an ho@@ ur , the j@@ ur@@ y deci@@ ded that I was gu@@ il@@ ty .
The jud@@ ge s@@ ent@@ enc@@ ed me to fi@@ ve years in pris@@ on in A@@ sh@@ land , K@@ en@@ tu@@ ck@@ y .
I sp@@ ent the first two we@@ e@@ ks in a pris@@ on in C@@ ol@@ um@@ bu@@ s , O@@ hi@@ o , and I sta@@ yed in my c@@ ell the first day .
I pray@@ ed to Jehovah : “ I cannot sta@@ y in a c@@ ell for fi@@ ve years .
The next day , the guar@@ ds let me out .
I wal@@ ked over to a t@@ all , bro@@ ad - sho@@ ul@@ dered pris@@ on@@ er , and we sto@@ od there loo@@ king out a w@@ in@@ do@@ w .
He asked me , “ What are you in for , S@@ hor@@ ty ? ”
I said , “ I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses . ”
He said , “ You are ?
So why are you here ? ”
I said , “ Jehovah’s Witnesses don@@ ’t go to war and k@@ ill people . ”
He said , “ They put you in pris@@ on because you won@@ ’t k@@ ill people .
I said , “ No , it do@@ es@@ n@@ ’t . ”
Then he said , “ For 15 years I was in another pris@@ on , where I read some of your liter@@ ature . ”
When I heard that , I pray@@ ed , “ Jehovah , help me get this man on my side . ”
So while I was there , I had no problems with the 50 pris@@ on@@ ers in that sec@@ tion .
I was among the Witnesses imp@@ ris@@ oned for ne@@ ut@@ r@@ ality at A@@ sh@@ land , K@@ en@@ tu@@ ck@@ y
When the off@@ i@@ ci@@ als moved me to the pris@@ on in A@@ sh@@ land , I me@@ t some mat@@ ure brothers who were already there .
They helped me and others to remain close to Jehovah .
There was a brother who would organi@@ ze our ter@@ rit@@ ory .
He would tell me : “ Ro@@ bis@@ on , you are respon@@ sible for bed such and such .
An@@ y@@ one assign@@ ed to that bed is your ter@@ rit@@ ory .
That is how we pre@@ ached in an organi@@ zed way .
World W@@ ar I@@ I en@@ ded in 19@@ 45 , but I sta@@ yed in pris@@ on for some time after that .
I said , “ T@@ hat@@ ’s fine , but I am not going into the ar@@ my . ”
I qu@@ o@@ ted 2 Timothy 2 : 3 and said , “ I am already a sol@@ di@@ er of Christ . ”
After a long s@@ il@@ ence , he said , “ You can leave . ”
So@@ on af@@ ter@@ ward , I atten@@ ded the Bethel meeting at a conven@@ tion in C@@ inc@@ in@@ nat@@ i , O@@ hi@@ o .
Bro@@ ther M@@ il@@ ton H@@ en@@ sc@@ he@@ l told us that there was a need at Bethel for brothers who wanted to work hard for the Kingdom .
I app@@ lied for Bethel service and was accepted .
I have always had a lo@@ t of work at Bethel .
For s@@ ever@@ al years , I op@@ er@@ ated the bo@@ il@@ ers in the prin@@ ter@@ y and the off@@ ice buil@@ d@@ ings , wor@@ ked as a ma@@ ch@@ in@@ ist , and rep@@ ai@@ red lo@@ c@@ ks .
I also wor@@ ked at As@@ se@@ mb@@ ly H@@ all@@ s in New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity .
I love the pro@@ gr@@ am@@ s at Bethel , such as mor@@ ning worship and the family Watchtower St@@ ud@@ y , as well as preaching with the congregation .
When you think about it , these are things that any family of Jehovah’s Witnesses should be doing reg@@ ularly .
When parents and children consider the da@@ ily t@@ ext together , have reg@@ ular F@@ am@@ ily Wor@@ ship s@@ essi@@ ons , par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate in the congregation meetings , and are ze@@ al@@ ous for preaching the good news , all in the family will likely remain close to Jehovah .
I have made many friends at Bethel and in the congregation .
But all of Jehovah’s servants are imperfect , including Be@@ th@@ el@@ ites .
If I have an ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent with a brother , I always try to make peace .
Now I have a hard time preaching from do@@ or to do@@ or because of my age , but I have not given up .
I have learned a little Man@@ dar@@ in C@@ hin@@ ese and enjoy appro@@ aching C@@ hin@@ ese people on the st@@ re@@ et .
Some mor@@ n@@ ings I place 30 or 40 ma@@ ga@@ zin@@ es with interest@@ ed ones .
P@@ re@@ aching to the C@@ hin@@ ese people in Bro@@ o@@ k@@ l@@ y@@ n , New Y@@ or@@ k
I have even made a return vis@@ it in C@@ h@@ ina !
One day , a n@@ ice young gir@@ l s@@ mil@@ ed at me as she pas@@ sed out ad@@ ver@@ t@@ is@@ ements for a fru@@ it stand .
I s@@ mil@@ ed and offered her The Watchtower and A@@ wa@@ ke !
in C@@ hin@@ ese .
She took them and told me that her name was K@@ ati@@ e .
After that , wh@@ en@@ ever she saw me , K@@ ati@@ e came over to talk to me .
I taught her the nam@@ es of fru@@ its and ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les in En@@ gl@@ ish , and she re@@ pe@@ ated the words after me .
I also explained Bible t@@ ex@@ ts to her , and she accepted the Bible T@@ each book .
After some we@@ e@@ ks , though , she dis@@ appe@@ ared .
M@@ on@@ ths later , I offered the ma@@ ga@@ zin@@ es to another gir@@ l who was pas@@ sing out ad@@ ver@@ t@@ is@@ ements , and she accepted them .
The next we@@ ek , she han@@ ded me her c@@ ell p@@ ho@@ ne and said , “ You talk to C@@ h@@ ina . ”
I said , “ I don@@ ’t know any@@ body in C@@ h@@ ina . ”
But she in@@ sist@@ ed , so I took the p@@ ho@@ ne and said , “ H@@ ell@@ o , this is Ro@@ bis@@ on . ”
The vo@@ ice at the other end said , “ Ro@@ b@@ by , this is K@@ ati@@ e .
I@@ ’@@ m back in C@@ h@@ ina . ”
Ro@@ b@@ by , you know that gir@@ l who han@@ ded you the p@@ ho@@ ne ? She@@ ’s my sister .
P@@ le@@ ase teach her the way you taught me . ”
I said , “ K@@ ati@@ e , I will do the best I can .
T@@ han@@ ks for let@@ ting me know where you are . ”
So@@ on af@@ ter@@ ward , I spoke to K@@ ati@@ e@@ ’s sister for the last time .
W@@ he@@ re@@ ver those two gir@@ ls are now , I hope that they learn more about Jehovah .
I have served Jehovah for 7@@ 3 years , and I am happy that he helped me to remain ne@@ ut@@ ra@@ l and to be faithful in pris@@ on .
Al@@ so , my si@@ bl@@ ings tell me that they were encoura@@ ged when I fa@@ ced D@@ ad@@ ’s op@@ position without giving up .
Even D@@ ad@@ ’s attitude chan@@ ged a little , and he atten@@ ded some meetings before he pas@@ sed away .
If it is God’s will , my family members and friends who have died will return to life in the new world .

How did knowledge and experience strengthen Abraha@@ m@@ ’s faith ?
What did Abraham do to strengthen his fri@@ end@@ ship with God ?
How can you imitate Abraham in building a fri@@ end@@ ship with Jehovah ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) How do we know that humans can become God’s friends ?
F@@ R@@ O@@ M the m@@ om@@ ent we are born to the m@@ om@@ ent we di@@ e , we need love .
Hu@@ man@@ s need close and loving fri@@ end@@ shi@@ ps , not just ro@@ man@@ tic love .
Many people do not believe that humans can have a close and loving fri@@ end@@ ship with God because he is inv@@ is@@ ib@@ le and al@@ mi@@ ghty .
We should learn from their examples .
So let us consider the example of Abraham .
( Read James 2 : 23 . )
How did he become God’s friend ?
Abraha@@ m@@ ’s close fri@@ end@@ ship with God was based on faith , and he is known as “ the father of all those having faith . ”
As you consider his example , ask yourself , ‘ How can I imitate Abraha@@ m@@ ’s faith and strengthen my fri@@ end@@ ship with Jehovah ? ’
3 , 4 . ( a ) Des@@ cri@@ be what was likely Abraha@@ m@@ ’s great@@ est t@@ est of faith . ( b ) Why was Abraham willing to sacrifice Isa@@ a@@ c ?
I@@ mag@@ ine Abraham at about 1@@ 25 years of age wal@@ king s@@ low@@ ly up a mo@@ un@@ tain .
Be@@ hin@@ d him was his son Isa@@ a@@ c , who was about 25 years old .
Isa@@ a@@ c car@@ ri@@ ed fi@@ re@@ wo@@ od , and Abraham car@@ ri@@ ed a k@@ ni@@ fe and the things needed to star@@ t a fir@@ e .
Instead , that j@@ our@@ ne@@ y was difficult because Jehovah had asked him to sacrifice his son ! ​ — Genesis 22 : 1 - 8 .
Abraham did not bl@@ in@@ dly obey God , that is , obey him without thinking
That was pro@@ bab@@ ly the great@@ est t@@ est of Abraha@@ m@@ ’s faith .
Some people say that God was c@@ ru@@ el for ask@@ ing Abraham to sacrifice his son .
He knew that Jehovah would never ask him to do anything that would cause per@@ man@@ ent har@@ m .
How may Abraham have learned about Jehovah , and how did that knowledge make him feel ?
K@@ no@@ w@@ led@@ ge .
Abraham gre@@ w up in a city called U@@ r .
She@@ m was a man of great faith , and he pro@@ bab@@ ly tal@@ ked to his relati@@ ves about Jehovah .
How did Abraha@@ m@@ ’s experienc@@ es strengthen his faith ?
Ex@@ peri@@ ence .
Some say that thoughts lead to feelings and feelings lead to actions .
The Bible call@@ s such deep respect “ godly fear . ”
In order to have a close fri@@ end@@ ship with God , we need to have godly fear .
It was that qu@@ ality that mo@@ tiv@@ ated Abraham to obey Jehovah .
They were no longer young , and they would have to live in t@@ ents for the rest of their lives .
Even though Abraham knew that there would be many dang@@ ers , he was determined to obey Jehovah .
Because of his obedience , God blessed and prot@@ ected him .
For example , when Abraha@@ m@@ ’s beau@@ ti@@ ful wife , Sar@@ ah , was taken away from him and he was in dang@@ er of being kill@@ ed , Jehovah mirac@@ ul@@ ously prot@@ ected both Abraham and Sar@@ ah more than once .
How can we gain knowledge and experience that will strengthen our fri@@ end@@ ship with Jehovah ?
Like Abraham , we need to learn about Jehovah .
And we too can gain the knowledge and experience we need .
This love and respect for God mo@@ tiv@@ ates us to obey him .
When we do , we see how he prot@@ ects and bless@@ es us , and this gives us experience that makes our faith str@@ ong@@ er .
9 , 10 . ( a ) What is needed for a fri@@ end@@ ship to become str@@ ong@@ er ?
( b ) What shows that Abraham ch@@ er@@ ished and strength@@ ened his fri@@ end@@ ship with Jehovah ?
( Read Proverbs 17 : 17 . )
It is not like an exp@@ en@@ sive v@@ ase that is used only for dec@@ or@@ ation .
It is more like a beau@@ ti@@ ful flo@@ wer that needs water and care to b@@ loo@@ m .
Abraham ch@@ er@@ ished and main@@ tain@@ ed his fri@@ end@@ ship with Jehovah .
For example , when he travel@@ ed to C@@ ana@@ an with his family and his servants , he continued to let Jehovah gu@@ ide him in making decisions both bi@@ g and small .
A year before Isa@@ a@@ c was born , when Abraham was 9@@ 9 years old , Jehovah told him to circum@@ c@@ ise all the ma@@ les in his house@@ hold .
Did Abraham doubt Jehovah or try to find an exc@@ use for not doing what he was asked ?
Why was Abraham concer@@ ned about So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ r@@ ah , and how did Jehovah help him ?
For example , when Jehovah said that he would destro@@ y the c@@ ities of So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ r@@ ah , Abraham was concer@@ ned .
He was af@@ ra@@ id that good people would di@@ e along with the bad .
He was pro@@ bab@@ ly wor@@ ri@@ ed about his ne@@ p@@ he@@ w Lo@@ t and his family , who lived in So@@ dom .
Jehovah was pati@@ ent with his friend and showed him that He is mer@@ ci@@ ful .
12 , 13 . ( a ) How did Abraha@@ m@@ ’s knowledge and experience help him later ?
( b ) What shows that Abraham had confidence in Jehovah ?
It is clear that all the knowledge and experience Abraham had ga@@ ined helped him to keep his fri@@ end@@ ship with Jehovah strong .
Be@@ fore lea@@ ving his servants , Abraham said : “ You sta@@ y here with the don@@ ke@@ y , but the bo@@ y and I will go over there and worship and return to you . ”
What did Abraham mean ?
W@@ as he l@@ ying about coming back with Isa@@ a@@ c , know@@ ing that he would sacrifice him ?
The Bible says that Abraham knew that Jehovah was able to resurrec@@ t Isa@@ a@@ c from the dead .
Abraham knew that Jehovah had given him the power to have a son even though he and Sar@@ ah were very old .
So he reali@@ zed that nothing was im@@ possible for Jehovah .
Abraham did not know what would happ@@ en that day .
That is why Abraham is called “ the father of all those having faith . ”
What challen@@ ges do you face in serving Jehovah , and how may Abraha@@ m@@ ’s example help you ?
S@@ ome@@ times we may not understand the reason for these comman@@ ds or we may find them hard to obey .
For some , the preaching work is difficult .
Ma@@ y@@ be they are sh@@ y and find it hard to talk to people they do not know .
When we med@@ itate on examples of faithful men and women , it can mo@@ tiv@@ ate us to imitate them and to draw clo@@ s@@ er to our F@@ ri@@ end , Jehovah . ​ — Hebrews 12 : 1 , 2 .
W@@ H@@ I@@ L@@ E L@@ I@@ V@@ IN@@ G IN U@@ R
Abraham and Sar@@ ah come to know and worship Jehovah
Abraham obe@@ ys God and lea@@ ves U@@ r
Jehovah prot@@ ects Abraham and Sar@@ ah during their j@@ our@@ ne@@ y

Abraham is obedi@@ ent and circum@@ c@@ is@@ es all ma@@ les of his house@@ hold
Jehovah pati@@ ently list@@ ens to Abraha@@ m@@ ’s concer@@ ns about So@@ dom
Jehovah makes it possible for Abraham and Sar@@ ah to have a son
Abraham dies “ at a good old age , old and satis@@ fied ”
Why may we be sure that Abraham never re@@ gre@@ t@@ ted his loyal obedience to Jehovah ?
The Bible says that Abraham “ died at a good old age , old and satis@@ fied . ”
However , when we read that Abraham was “ old and satis@@ fied , ” this does not mean that he had no desire to live in the future .
What jo@@ ys will Abraham experience in Par@@ adise ?
The Bible says that Abraham “ was awa@@ iting the city having real fo@@ und@@ ations , whose des@@ ign@@ er and buil@@ der is God . ”
Abraham believ@@ ed that one day he would see that city , the Kingdom of God , rul@@ ing over the earth .
In Par@@ adise he will find out that the sacrifice on Mo@@ unt M@@ or@@ iah illustr@@ ated something much greater .
And he will learn how the pain he felt when he prepar@@ ed to sacrifice his son Isa@@ a@@ c has helped milli@@ ons of faithful people to understand Jehovah’s pain when he gave his Son , Jesus Christ , as a ransom for mankind .
What is your determin@@ ation , and what will we consider in the following article ?
May each of us be determined to imitate the faith of Abraham .
Like him , we need knowledge and experience .
In the following article , we will consider three more examples of faithful ones who became close friends of God .
[ 1 ] ( par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph 3 ) Abraham and Sar@@ ah were orig@@ in@@ ally called Abra@@ m and Sar@@ ai .
But in this article , we will use the nam@@ es that Jehovah later gave them .
As we learn about him , we will beg@@ in to have deep love and respect for him .
SONGS : 10@@ 6 , 1@@ 18
What can we learn from the fri@@ end@@ ship with God that Ruth enjo@@ yed ?
Why was King He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah a close friend of Jehovah ?
What qualities made Jesus ’ mother , Mary , a friend of Jehovah God ?
1 - 3 . ( a ) Why can we be sure that we can become God’s friends ?
( b ) What individuals will we consider in this article ?
IN THE Bible , Abraham is called God’s friend three times .
Does that mean that Abraham is the only human ever to become Jehovah’s friend ?
( Read Psalm 25 : 14 . )
They are part of the “ great cl@@ ou@@ d of w@@ itnesses ” mentioned by Paul .
All these different individuals were God’s friends . ​ — Hebrews 12 : 1 .
What difficult decision did Ruth have to make , and why was making it so hard ?
Na@@ omi and her daugh@@ ters - in - law , Ruth and O@@ r@@ p@@ ah , were wal@@ king the long dist@@ ance from Mo@@ a@@ b to Israel .
What did Ruth deci@@ de to do ?
W@@ ould she go back home to Mo@@ a@@ b to be with her family , or would she sta@@ y with Na@@ omi , her mother - in - law , and tra@@ v@@ el to Be@@ th@@ le@@ he@@ m ? ​ — Ruth 1 : 1 - 8 , 14 .
She could return to them , and they would pro@@ bab@@ ly take care of her .
And Na@@ omi was af@@ ra@@ id that she would not find a husband or a home for her .
So Na@@ omi told her to go back to Mo@@ a@@ b .
But Ruth deci@@ ded not to return to her people and their false go@@ ds .
( a ) What wise cho@@ ice did Ruth make ?
( b ) Why did Bo@@ a@@ z speak of Ruth as seeking re@@ fu@@ ge under Jehovah’s w@@ ings ?
It seem@@ s that Ruth learned about Jehovah from her husband or from Na@@ omi .
She learned that Jehovah was not like the go@@ ds of Mo@@ a@@ b .
She loved Jehovah and knew that he deser@@ ved her love and her worship .
She told Na@@ omi : “ Your people will be my people , and your God my God . ”
This also im@@ pres@@ sed Bo@@ a@@ z , who later pra@@ ised her for ‘ seeking re@@ fu@@ ge under Jehovah’s w@@ ings . ’
( Read Ruth 2 : 12 . )
The words Bo@@ a@@ z used may re@@ mind us of how a bab@@ y bir@@ d loo@@ ks for prot@@ ection under its par@@ ent@@ ’s w@@ ings .
In a similar way , Jehovah gave Ruth loving prot@@ ection and re@@ war@@ ded her for her faith .
Ruth never had any reason to re@@ gre@@ t her decision .
What might help those who h@@ es@@ itate to dedic@@ ate their lives to Jehovah ?
Many people learn about Jehovah but cho@@ ose not to take re@@ fu@@ ge in him .
They h@@ es@@ itate to dedic@@ ate their lives to him and get baptized .
If you feel the same way , think about why you h@@ es@@ itate .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one ser@@ ves one go@@ d or another .
The wise cho@@ ice would be to serve the true God .
When you dedic@@ ate yourself to Jehovah , you show that you have faith that he will be a re@@ fu@@ ge for you .
He was part of a nation that was dedic@@ ated to God .
He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah’s father , King A@@ ha@@ z , was wicked .
He showed dis@@ respect for God’s temple and con@@ vin@@ ced the people to worship other go@@ ds .
A@@ ha@@ z even had some of He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah’s brothers bur@@ ned ali@@ ve as sacrifices to a false go@@ d .
He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah had a ter@@ ri@@ ble chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od ! ​ — 2 K@@ ings 16 : 2 - 4 , 10 - 17 ; 2 Chr@@ on@@ ic@@ les 28 : 1 - 3 .
9 , 10 . ( a ) Why might He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah eas@@ ily have become b@@ it@@ ter ?
( b ) Why should we not become b@@ it@@ ter against God ?
( c ) Why should we not think that our ba@@ ck@@ gro@@ und determin@@ es the ty@@ pe of person we will become ?
The bad example of A@@ ha@@ z could have cau@@ sed his son He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah to become b@@ it@@ ter or ang@@ ry with Jehovah .
Today , some who have had to endure far less than He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah feel that they have good reason to become “ en@@ ra@@ ged against Jehovah ” or b@@ it@@ ter toward his organization .
O@@ thers feel that their bad family ba@@ ck@@ gro@@ und may cause them to have a bad life or to re@@ pe@@ at their parents ’ mis@@ takes .
He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah’s life pro@@ ves that the answer to that question is no !
He does not cause bad things to happ@@ en to people .
Because Jehovah has given us the gift of free will , which means that we can cho@@ ose to do what is good or what is bad .
Many young people accept the truth des@@ pite their family ba@@ ck@@ gro@@ und ( See par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s 9 , 10 )
What made He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah one of Ju@@ da@@ h@@ ’s best k@@ ings ?
Even though his father was one of the wor@@ st k@@ ings in Judah , He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah became one of the very best .
( Read 2 K@@ ings 18 : 5 , 6 . )
This mo@@ tiv@@ ated him to fi@@ x many of the problems his father had cau@@ sed .
He trust@@ ed in Jehovah’s prot@@ ection and strength@@ ened his people .
At one point He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah became p@@ r@@ ou@@ d , but when Jehovah cor@@ rec@@ ted him , he hum@@ bl@@ ed himself .
He did not let his family ba@@ ck@@ gro@@ und ru@@ in his life .
Like He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , how have many today proved to be Jehovah’s friends ?
The world today is c@@ ru@@ el and un@@ loving , and many children gro@@ w up without loving and car@@ ing parents .
Even though many Christians today come from difficult family ba@@ ck@@ gro@@ un@@ ds , they have cho@@ s@@ en to build a fri@@ end@@ ship with Jehovah .
Like He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , they show that their family ba@@ ck@@ gro@@ und does not need to determin@@ e what kind of person they will become in the future .
God has given us the gift of free will , and we can cho@@ ose to serve and honor him , as He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah did .
Why might Mar@@ y’s assign@@ ment have seem@@ ed too difficult , yet how did she respond to G@@ ab@@ ri@@ el@@ ’s words ?
She would become pre@@ gn@@ ant and give bir@@ th to and ra@@ ise God’s Son !
We often talk about the great honor Mary was given .
But what may have been some of her f@@ ears ?
How would she con@@ vin@@ ce Joseph that she had not been un@@ faithful to him ?
In ad@@ dition , she had the great responsibility of ra@@ ising God’s Son as a human !
Why is Mar@@ y’s faith re@@ mar@@ k@@ able ?
How could Mary have such strong faith ?
But we can have faith if we cultiv@@ ate it and ask God to bl@@ ess our efforts .
What shows that Mary was a good list@@ en@@ er ?
How Mary list@@ ened .
The Bible says that we “ must be quic@@ k to listen , s@@ low to speak . ”
She took time to med@@ itate on such important things .
One example of this was at Jesus ’ bir@@ th when shepher@@ ds told Mary about a message from an ang@@ el .
In both c@@ as@@ es , Mary list@@ ened , re@@ me@@ m@@ be@@ red , and thought care@@ fully about what she had heard . ​ — Read Luke 2 : 16 - 19 , 4@@ 9 , 5@@ 1 .
What can we learn about Mary from the way she spoke ?
The Bible does not tell us much about what Mary said .
H@@ er long@@ est spe@@ ech is found at Luke 1 : 46 - 5@@ 5 .
It seem@@ s that Mary qu@@ o@@ ted the Scriptures about 20 times in her spe@@ ech .
In what ways can we imitate Mar@@ y’s faith ?
Like Mary , we may at times receive assign@@ ments from Jehovah that we think are too difficult for us .
Let us imitate her example , hum@@ b@@ ly accept the assign@@ ment , and trust that Jehovah will help us .
As we imitate the Bib@@ le’s out@@ standing examples of faith , of what may we be as@@ su@@ red ?
It is clear that Ruth , He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , and Mary were Jehovah’s friends , just as Abraham was .
TH@@ IN@@ K about the happ@@ i@@ est day of your life .
W@@ as it when you got married or when your first child was born ?
V@@ er@@ y likely , you have experienced much joy in serving Jehovah since your baptism .
What reasons do we have for continu@@ ing to serve Jehovah with joy ?
Because Jehovah promises that the Kingdom will soon put an end to this wicked world and bring in God’s new world .
Z@@ ep@@ han@@ iah 1 : 14 tell@@ s us : “ The great day of Jehovah is near ! It is near and it is appro@@ aching very quic@@ kly ! ”
But if we feel that we have to wa@@ it longer than exp@@ ected , we could lo@@ se the joy we once had .
When we sp@@ end time with our brothers and sisters , we feel encoura@@ ged to keep on serving Jehovah with joy .
The good conduct of Jehovah’s people may have att@@ ra@@ cted us to true worship and helped us to beg@@ in serving God jo@@ y@@ fully .
However , what could happ@@ en if one of our brothers or sisters was discipl@@ ined because he or she did not obey God’s comman@@ ds ?
Satan’s world tri@@ es to con@@ vin@@ ce us that we should bu@@ y things that we really do not need .
Re@@ member that Jesus said : “ C@@ ome to me , all you who are to@@ il@@ ing and lo@@ ad@@ ed down , and I will ref@@ res@@ h you .
T@@ ake my yo@@ ke upon you and learn from me , for I am mil@@ d - tem@@ pe@@ red and low@@ ly in heart , and you will find ref@@ re@@ sh@@ ment for y@@ ourselves .
Be@@ ing a true Christian is ref@@ re@@ sh@@ ing and br@@ ings us joy .
We certainly have good reasons for being jo@@ y@@ ful in Jehovah’s service .
Let us now consider three of them . ​ — Hab@@ akku@@ k 3 : 18 .
We serve our Li@@ fe - G@@ i@@ ver , the happy God .
We reali@@ ze that we o@@ we our lives to our Creator .
So let us continue to serve him with joy , regar@@ d@@ less of how many years have g@@ one by since we got baptized .
H@@ é@@ ct@@ or keep@@ s his joy by re@@ memb@@ ering his Kingdom hope and sta@@ ying ac@@ tive
Consider H@@ é@@ ct@@ or , who served Jehovah as a travel@@ ing overse@@ er for 40 years .
“ Even in old age , ” he still enjo@@ ys serving Jehovah .
His wi@@ fe@@ ’s ill@@ ness has lim@@ ited his activ@@ ity in God’s service , but H@@ é@@ ct@@ or has not lost his joy .
He says : “ Although it is sa@@ d to see my wi@@ fe@@ ’s health gra@@ du@@ ally de@@ ter@@ i@@ or@@ ate and it has been challen@@ ging to care for her , I have not allow@@ ed this to ro@@ b me of my joy in serving the true God .
K@@ no@@ wing that I o@@ we my life to Jehovah , who cre@@ ated man for a purpose , is reason en@@ ough to love him deep@@ ly and serve him who@@ le@@ hear@@ te@@ dly .
I stri@@ ve to sta@@ y ac@@ tive in the preaching work , and I try to keep the Kingdom hope fore@@ most in my mind so as not to lo@@ se my joy . ”
Jehovah has provided the ransom sacrifice , making it possible for us to have a jo@@ y@@ ful life .
Indeed , “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - be@@ go@@ t@@ ten Son , so that every@@ one exerc@@ ising faith in him might not be destro@@ yed but have everlasting life . ”
And our gr@@ at@@ itude for the ransom will mo@@ tiv@@ ate us to serve Jehovah jo@@ y@@ fully .
Je@@ s@@ ú@@ s simp@@ li@@ fied his life and served Jehovah jo@@ y@@ fully for years
I did it just to make more money .
Then I learned about Jehovah and how he had given his de@@ ar Son for mankind .
I had an inten@@ se desire to serve him .
So I dedic@@ ated my life to Jehovah , and after having wor@@ ked for the comp@@ any for 28 years , I deci@@ ded to qu@@ it and take up the full - time ministry . ”
That is how Je@@ s@@ ú@@ s star@@ ted serving Jehovah with joy .
We live a mor@@ ally clean life , which br@@ ings us happiness .
Do you remember what your life was like before you came to know Jehovah ?
The apostle Paul remin@@ ded Christians in R@@ ome that they “ were once the sla@@ ves of sin ” but had become “ sla@@ ves to righteousness . ”
We too follow Jehovah’s standards , so we are free from the sa@@ dness that comes from an immor@@ al or viol@@ ent way of life .
What a cause for joy !
“ The happ@@ i@@ est years of my life have been those sp@@ ent serving Jehovah . ” ​ — J@@ a@@ im@@ e
“ L@@ it@@ tle by little , I dis@@ co@@ vered the exist@@ ence of a loving Father and mer@@ ci@@ ful God , ” J@@ a@@ im@@ e says .
“ Ke@@ ep@@ ing Jehovah’s righteous standards has been a prot@@ ection for me .
H@@ ad I not chan@@ ged , I might have been kill@@ ed , as some of my form@@ er bo@@ x@@ ing friends were .
The happ@@ i@@ est years of my life have been those sp@@ ent serving Jehovah . ”
How should we feel while we wa@@ it for the end of this wicked world ?
“ So let us not give up in doing what is fine , for in du@@ e time we will re@@ a@@ p if we do not ti@@ re out . ”
With Jehovah’s help , let us endure , work hard to cultiv@@ ate the qualities we need to sur@@ vi@@ ve “ the great tribulation , ” and continue to serve Jehovah with joy . ​ — Revelation 7 : 9 , 13 , 14 ; James 1 : 2 - 4 .
We can be conf@@ ident that Jehovah will re@@ ward our end@@ ur@@ ance because he kno@@ ws the work we do and the love we show for him and his name .
If we keep on serving him with joy , we will be like the psalmist David , who said : “ I keep Jehovah before me con@@ stan@@ tly .
And I re@@ side in sec@@ ur@@ ity . ” ​ — Psalm 16 : 8 , 9 .
How was King S@@ aul’s son Jon@@ a@@ than loyal to Jehovah ?
How can we be loyal to God when we feel that someone who has authority does not deser@@ ve our respect ?
How can we be loyal to Jehovah if others mis@@ understand us or tre@@ at us un@@ fa@@ ir@@ ly ?
Why is Jon@@ a@@ th@@ an’s fri@@ end@@ ship with David a re@@ mar@@ k@@ able example of lo@@ yal@@ ty ?
J@@ ON@@ A@@ T@@ HA@@ N must have been a@@ ma@@ zed at how coura@@ ge@@ ous young David was .
David had kill@@ ed the gi@@ ant Go@@ li@@ ath and brought “ the head of the Phi@@ list@@ ine ” to Jon@@ a@@ th@@ an’s father , King Saul of Israel .
Jon@@ a@@ than had no doubt that God was with David , and from then on , Jon@@ a@@ than and David became very close friends .
They promised that they would always be loyal to each other .
And when Saul was tr@@ ying to k@@ ill David , Jon@@ a@@ than was wor@@ ri@@ ed about his friend .
He knew that David was in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness at Ho@@ res@@ h , so Jon@@ a@@ than went there to encoura@@ ge him to keep rel@@ ying on Jehovah .
Jon@@ a@@ than told David : “ Do not be af@@ ra@@ id , for my father Saul will not find you ; you will be king over Israel , and I will become second to you . ” ​ — 1 Samu@@ el 23 : 16 , 17 .
What was more important to Jon@@ a@@ than than being loyal to David , and how do we know ?
We usu@@ ally ad@@ m@@ ire people who are loyal .
In fact , that is the reason why he was loyal to David and was not je@@ al@@ ous of him , al@@ though David would become king inst@@ e@@ ad of him .
( a ) What will make us truly happy and satis@@ fied ?
We too must be loyal to our family , our friends , and our brothers and sisters in the congregation .
But we know that we must be loyal to God even in difficult times .
In this article , we will discus@@ s how Jon@@ a@@ th@@ an’s example can help us to sta@@ y loyal to Jehovah in four situ@@ ations : ( 1 ) when we feel that someone who has authority does not deser@@ ve our respect , ( 2 ) when we have to cho@@ ose to whom we should be loyal , ( 3 ) when a brother taking the lead mis@@ under@@ stan@@ ds us or tre@@ at@@ s us un@@ fa@@ ir@@ ly , and ( 4 ) when we feel it is difficult to keep a promise .
Why was it difficult for the people of Israel to be loyal to God while Saul was king ?
Jon@@ a@@ than and the people of Israel were in a difficult situation .
King Saul , Jon@@ a@@ th@@ an’s father , had become dis@@ obedi@@ ent , and Jehovah rej@@ ected him .
What shows that Jon@@ a@@ than sta@@ yed loyal to Jehovah ?
Jon@@ a@@ than sta@@ yed loyal to Jehovah .
At that time , a large ar@@ my of Phi@@ list@@ in@@ es came with 3@@ 0@@ ,000 char@@ i@@ o@@ ts to atta@@ ck Israel .
But Jon@@ a@@ than was not af@@ ra@@ id .
He re@@ me@@ m@@ be@@ red the words of the prophet Samu@@ el : “ For the sake of his great name , Jehovah will not ab@@ an@@ don his people . ”
Jon@@ a@@ than said to another sol@@ di@@ er : “ No@@ thing can hin@@ der Jehovah from sa@@ ving by many or by few . ”
So he and the sol@@ di@@ er atta@@ c@@ ked a group of Phi@@ list@@ in@@ es and kill@@ ed about 20 of them .
Jon@@ a@@ than had faith in Jehovah , and Jehovah blessed him .
Even though Saul continued to dis@@ obey Jehovah , Jon@@ a@@ than still obe@@ yed his father wh@@ en@@ ever possible .
For example , they f@@ ought together to de@@ f@@ end Jehovah’s people . ​ — 1 Samu@@ el 31 : 1 , 2 .
How are we being loyal to God when we respect those who have authority ?
Like Jon@@ a@@ than , we can be loyal to Jehovah by obe@@ ying wh@@ en@@ ever possible the govern@@ ment of the coun@@ try where we live .
That is why we should tre@@ at a govern@@ ment off@@ i@@ cial with respect even when he is not hon@@ est and we feel he does not deser@@ ve our respect .
He even told her that he would leave her and take the children with him .
But O@@ l@@ ga did not “ return evil for evil . ”
She did her best to be a good wife .
And when she could , she went with him to vis@@ it his family and friends .
After many years , O@@ l@@ ga@@ ’s husband star@@ ted to tre@@ at her better because she had been so pati@@ ent and always showed him respect .
How did Jon@@ a@@ than know to whom he should be loyal ?
When Saul said that he was going to k@@ ill David , Jon@@ a@@ than had a difficult decision to make .
He wanted to be loyal to his father , but he also wanted to be loyal to David .
He war@@ ned David to hi@@ de and then told Saul why he should let David live . ​ — Read 1 Samu@@ el 19 : 1 - 6 .
How does our love for God help us deci@@ de to be loyal to him ?
Al@@ ice , a sister from A@@ ustr@@ ali@@ a , had to deci@@ de to whom she would be loyal .
She also told them that she would not c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ate Christ@@ ma@@ s with them and explained why .
They felt that Al@@ ice did not care about them any@@ more .
Then her mother said that she never wanted to see Al@@ ice again .
Al@@ ice said : “ I was sho@@ c@@ ked and deep@@ ly hur@@ t because I really loved my family .
N@@ ever@@ th@@ eless , I res@@ ol@@ ved that Jehovah and his Son would be first in my heart , and I got baptized at the next asse@@ mb@@ ly . ” ​ — Matthew 10 : 37 .
We must not let lo@@ yal@@ ty to anything , such as a sp@@ orts te@@ am , a school , or a coun@@ try , become more important to us than our lo@@ yal@@ ty to Jehovah .
For example , H@@ en@@ ry enjo@@ yed pla@@ ying ch@@ ess with his school te@@ am and wanted to w@@ in a cha@@ m@@ pi@@ on@@ ship for his school .
H@@ en@@ ry said that it had become more important for him to be loyal to the school than to God .
How can lo@@ yal@@ ty to God help us to cop@@ e with family problems ?
S@@ ome@@ times it can be hard to be loyal to different members of our family at the same time .
For example , K@@ en says : “ I wanted to vis@@ it my el@@ derly mother reg@@ ularly and to have her sta@@ y with us occas@@ i@@ on@@ ally .
But my mother and my wife did not get along well . ”
He continu@@ es : “ I could not please one without dis@@ pleas@@ ing the other . ”
K@@ en thought about what the Bible says and reali@@ zed that in this situation , he had to please his wife and be loyal to her .
So he found a sol@@ u@@ tion that his wife was happy with .
He also explained to his mother why she should respect his wife . ​ — Read Genesis 2 : 24 ; 1 Corinthians 13 : 4 , 5 .
How did Saul tre@@ at Jon@@ a@@ than un@@ fa@@ ir@@ ly ?
We can also be loyal to Jehovah if a brother who is taking the lead tre@@ at@@ s us un@@ fa@@ ir@@ ly .
At the same time , he sta@@ yed loyal to Jehovah and to David , who was cho@@ s@@ en by God to be the next king of Israel . ​ — 1 Samu@@ el 20 : 30 - 41 .
If a brother tre@@ at@@ s us un@@ fa@@ ir@@ ly , how should we re@@ act ?
In our congregations today , the brothers taking the lead try to be fa@@ ir to every@@ one .
So if we are ever mis@@ jud@@ ged or mis@@ under@@ sto@@ od , let us sta@@ y loyal to Jehovah .
In what situ@@ ations must we be loyal to God and not be sel@@ f@@ ish ?
But Jon@@ a@@ than loved Jehovah and was loyal to him .
So inst@@ e@@ ad of being sel@@ f@@ ish , Jon@@ a@@ than became D@@ av@@ id@@ ’s friend and kept his promise to him .
For example , if we make a bu@@ sin@@ ess agre@@ ement , we will do what we agre@@ ed to do , even if this becom@@ es difficult .
If we make a bu@@ sin@@ ess agre@@ ement , we will do what we agre@@ ed to do because we are loyal to God ( See par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph 16 )
We want to be loyal to God even in difficult situ@@ ations , as Jon@@ a@@ than was .
So let us sta@@ y loyal to our brothers and sisters when they dis@@ ap@@ point us .
Then we will make Jehovah’s heart rejo@@ ice , and that is what makes us happ@@ i@@ est .
In the next article , we will see what we can learn from some in D@@ av@@ id@@ ’s time who were loyal and from others who were not loyal .
[ 1 ] ( par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph 9 ) Some nam@@ es have been chan@@ ged .
In difficult situ@@ ations , we think of what he wants us to do and then obey him because we love him more than anyone or anything el@@ se
“ Su@@ peri@@ or author@@ ities ” : The govern@@ ments and off@@ i@@ ci@@ als that Jehovah al@@ lo@@ ws to have authority over us .
He wants us to tre@@ at them with respect and obey them ex@@ ce@@ pt when they want us to do something that he comman@@ ds us not to do
On@@ ly to exerc@@ ise justice , to ch@@ er@@ ish lo@@ yal@@ ty , and to walk in mo@@ des@@ ty with your God ! ” ​ — M@@ I@@ C@@ A@@ H 6 : 8 .
Why was Jon@@ a@@ th@@ an’s re@@ action to David so different from Ab@@ n@@ er@@ ’s ?
What qualities will help us to be loyal to God , and how ?
How did David show that he was loyal to God ?
But David would not let him k@@ ill Saul .
He told A@@ bis@@ ha@@ i : “ Do not har@@ m him , for who can li@@ ft his hand against the anointed of Jehovah and remain in@@ no@@ c@@ ent ? ”
David under@@ sto@@ od what he needed to do to be loyal to Jehovah .
He knew he should respect Saul , and he did not even think of hur@@ ting him .
Today , as in the past , Jehovah wants all of his servants to be loyal to him and respect those whom he al@@ lo@@ ws to have authority . ​ — Read Mic@@ ah 6 : 8 .
A@@ bis@@ ha@@ i resp@@ ected David because he knew that God had cho@@ s@@ en David to be king .
Yet after becom@@ ing king , David comm@@ it@@ ted serious sins .
( a ) How was David an example of lo@@ yal@@ ty to God ?
( b ) What other examples will we consider ?
David was loyal to Jehovah all his life .
I@@ m@@ medi@@ ately , David ad@@ mit@@ ted that he had sin@@ ned , and he rep@@ ented .
L@@ ater , when David was an old man , he gave many valu@@ able things to help build Jehovah’s temple .
And we will discus@@ s other qualities that will help us to do so .
What les@@ son do we learn from A@@ bis@@ hai@@ ’s mis@@ take ?
When A@@ bis@@ ha@@ i wanted to k@@ ill Saul , he was tr@@ ying to be loyal to David .
But because David knew that it would be wrong to har@@ m “ the anointed of Jehovah , ” he did not let A@@ bis@@ ha@@ i k@@ ill the king .
