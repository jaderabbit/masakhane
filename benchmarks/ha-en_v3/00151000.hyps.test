Answers to Bible Questions
( Read James 5 : 14 - 16 . )
Paul described the bad attitude we live when he said : “ I am a man of conduct , and I do only sin .
We will find the answers in this article .
( Read Hebrews 10 : 24 , 25 . )
( Read 2 Corinthians 8 : 13 - 15 . )
However , “ Noah was righteous and unblemished in his peers . Noah walked with God . ” ​ — Gen .
Proverbs 14 : 15 states : “ The inexperienced person is putting faith in every word , but the career takes note of his ways well . ”
For my yoke is simple , and my load is weighed down . ”
Though we grew up , regardless of what soil , love enables us to be united .
Of course , this is a thankful thing .
And if your right eye makes you stumbled , remove him and leave it . ”
Hitota , a manslayer of money , was a campaign in Japan .
Hitota said that he could not do so .
As a result , he was expelled from work .
Hitota felt discouraged when he spent months seeking a job .
For example , in one area where he went to work , Hitos noted that he did not want to do a job involving drug .
Hito’s family encouraged him to stand firm in the truth , yet he began to doubt .
Even when he said , “ Is it true ? ”
The account of Hitos is a serious story because it shows that many do not want the truth .
Certainly , some may feel that this is especially in a business area .
One woman who worked in South Africa said : “ The people we work together are not honest , and at times they may pressure you to follow their attitude . ”
We do not expect false lies to business on earth . ”
Is it not surprising that people do not want to be misled , yet they have themselves lie ?
Why do lie , stealing , and other unrighteous attitudes fill the earth ?
How does injustice affect people completely ?
Most important , how can we avoid becoming unrighteous ?
“ In most cases , adults may be solved by injustice . ” ​ — Samantha , South Africa .
Do you agree with that statement ?
Like Samantha , all of us have experienced adults .
And we will have bad results when we realize that we are missing .
However , unhonesty once can break this relationship .
And as soon as the conversion of one another can be a challenge to accept one another .
If you continue to maintain a friendship with untruth , you too will follow his attitude .
Please consider some Bible principles ahead .
False and enemy can be destroyed .
“ We have good conscience , and we want to conduct ourselves honestly in all things . ” ​ — Hebrews 13 : 18 .
In the Bible , the original Greek word and at times translated “ honesty ” refers to “ something real . ”
And Christians view this statement seriously .
Most people look at themselves in a mirror each morning before they go to their daily affairs .
Because they wanted to do so .
God’s Word clearly states that we want to do bad things .
Genesis 8 : 21 , states : “ The thought of the heart of man is bad from his youth .
The apostle Paul described a struggle or effort to stop sinning , saying : “ I am blind , in the city of my heart , I agree with God’s law , but I see another principle in my members , which is fighting against the principle that my perceptive powers took me if I have sinned in my place of sin . ” ​ — Romans 7 : 23 , 23 .
We can choose what we can do .
We need good morality to become honest .
Sadly , many focus on “ good clothing ” instead of having good qualities .
The book The ( Honest ) Truth About Dishonesty ( Truth on Truth ) states : “ We are disastrous about how to discover us as injustice to safeguard our personality . ”
Yes .
Millions of people around the world have found that only the Bible can help us .
He guides us in the matter of family life , morality , and our relationship with God .
His laws and principles are beneficial to all .
If we carefully examine the Bible , meditate on it and apply what we read , we can discern how we can honestly and righteousness .
However , there is no measure of knowledge of the Bible to make us successful in stopping injustice .
Because we live in a world that people try to influence us to pursue moral standards .
Hence , we need to pray for God’s help .
Doing so will help us to develop the courage to do what is right and honest in our daily affairs .
Hitos mentioned in the first article of this magazine succeeded in being honest .
Hitota says : “ I am happy that now I am working with a clean conscience . ”
Some even accepted what he said .
Later , I married and I began to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses .
We changed our life because we learned that Jehovah * hates injustice .
We were baptized as Jehovah’s Witnesses in 1990 . ” ​ — Proverbs 6 : 16 - 19 .
“ In the past , my home was filled with stealing but now there was no stealing in my home and that made me feel secure .
If I remembered the years I suffered , I thank Jehovah for mercy .
“ When my master realized that I refused to accept a brief from a storm , he said to me : ‘ Your God has made you have such a fine attitude !
True in daily affairs helps me to maintain a good conscience before Jehovah God .
“ I worked as a helper in a large bank .
The viewpoint of most people is , ‘ It is not wrong to be made for more money or in economic hardships . ’
I decided to be honest despite what .
My leaders knew that I would not lie them and would not lie them . ” ​ — Tom in the United States .
When the thief was arrested , the campaign thanked me for my decision .
Being honest in a dishonest world requires courage .
But if we do so , people will trust us and respect us . ” ​ — Kaori in Japan .

JEHOVAH , The Watchtower , is published for honor to Jehovah God , the Sovereign of heaven and earth .
It encourages people that God’s Kingdom will eliminate all wickedness and restore the earth a paradise soon .
It gives faith in Jesus Christ , who died so that we can gain everlasting life and who now is the King of God’s Kingdom .
This magazine has been published since 1879 , and this magazine is not political .

The scriptures used here are found in the Bible in Hausa’s Convention .
Whenever you see that it is written , it is referred to a Bible translation .
If you see , the New World Translation is referred to .
Barbara * grew up with her father before he died .
That is why her friend told her not comforting her .
She wondered : “ Well , then , is it the greatest depression ? ”
Years later , Barbara wrote what happened in the book and realized that she still did not stop grieving .
Barbara also realized that he took time to stop grief , especially when the man was overwhelmed before his death .
The Bible says that death is “ the last enemy . ”
Death is not expectedly expected , and this makes us feel very distressed .
How we can avoid it .
It is not surprising to lose my life after someone died .
You may have wondered : ‘ When will I stop the mourning ?
How can I comfort others who are grieving ?
Will I see my relatives or friends who have died ? ’
Have you ever been sick for a time ?
But he added : “ Sometimes , and with the help of others , the weak will diminish . ”
For example , consider how Abraham felt when his wife died .
It would have been a short time before Abraham began to be healed .
He grieved for “ many days ” and his relatives could not comfort him .
Years later , Jacob kept grieving for his son Joseph . ​ — Genesis 23 : 2 ; 37 : 34 , 35 ; 42 : 36 ; 45 : 28 .
“ My husband Robert , died on July 9 , 2008 , a camp .
I was six years of grief for his death .
I felt that I would never stop my husband . ” ​ — Gail , 60 years old .
“ Although my wife died for eight years , I still am surprised and was surprised .
When I saw a beautiful creation , I remembered her because I knew that she had been alive , she wanted the creation . ” ​ — Etienne , 84 .
Of course , a long - term grief is not wrong .
How grievous people are , so it is not wise to be angry when someone has been grieved .
And we should not see ourselves guilty because we are temporary .
As we have seen in the article “ Imitate Their Faith ” in this Watchtower , Isaac has been amazed for three years . ​ — Genesis 24 : 67 .
For example , some may say that you do not weep or show that you are depressed .
Others may ask you to weep and show your grief .
The Bible provides an excellent advice that some modern - day researchers agree with it .
Some customs have the idea that each man who wept is not a husband .
Is it a shame to weep in the crowd ?
The doctors say that the pouring of tears are not wrong .
And grieving can help you to keep on living anything of your grief .
We can harm ourselves if we refuse to weep .
The Bible does not support the idea that it is wrong to weep or to weep .
Although he had the power to resurrect his friend Lazarus from death , he cried in the crowd ! ​ — John 11 : 33 - 35 .
Sadly , grief can cause a person to be angry especially when the debt comes unexpected .
The mourning may be angry if some who see and dignity comments a wrong statement .
Mike from South Africa said : “ I was 14 years old when my father died .
When his funeral was funeral , a Angil’s church church said that God wants people to be kind in heaven .
* This offended me deeply because we still need our father .
For example , a man who is grieved may wonder , ‘ Perhaps he does not have died if I had done something to do something , ’ particularly if the loss did not expect .
If you have such thoughts and feelings , you should not hide that in your heart .
Instead , tell your friend who will listen to you and assure you that the grieving ones do .
The Bible says : “ A friend always does , and a brother is born for the time of distress . ” ​ — Proverbs 17 : 17 .
The greatest confidence that a person has is our Creator , Jehovah .
Tell him all your concerns to ‘ care for you . ’
In addition , he promised that all who do so will have “ the peace of God that is far more than all understanding . ”
Still , rely on God and the Bible to help you reduce your grief .
Having these scriptures in mind can help you especially at night when you think and fail to sleep . ​ — Isaiah 57 : 15 .
In recent times , the wife of a man whom we would call him Jack died to disease himself .
“ When I prayed to Jehovah , ” he said , “ I
I often got up at night and failed to sleep .
But if I read scriptures and meditate on them along with telling Jehovah how I feel , I feel secure and that makes me sleep . ”
Vanessa died in sickness .
She too prayed for help .
She says : “ At times I felt very distressed , I called Jehovah’s name only and tears .
Jehovah heard my prayer and helped me deeply . ”
Some scholars say that what can help is to give up in the ministry that can help the people .
Doing such activities can cause a grief person to be happy and to forget the condition he is in .
Many grieving Christians have found that helping people to find comfort . ​ — 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 .
God is compassionate for us when we face difficult circumstances . ​ — Psalm 55 : 22 ; 1 Peter 5 : 7 .
God listens to the prayers of his servants . ​ — Psalm 86 : 5 ; 1 Thessalonians 5 : 17 .
God is eager to see those who have died . ​ — Job 14 : 13 - 15 .
God promises to resurrect the dead . ​ — Isaiah 26 : 19 ; John 5 : 28 , 29 .
Have you ever lost what you would tell someone who is grieving ?
At times , if we do not have to say , we look forward .
But there are some good things we can do .
Often , what you need to say is “ Be patient . ”
In many cultures , the way to show that you are concerned about the grief is the embrace of him or to hold him in a fiery way .
If the mourning wants to speak , listen to him .
The most important thing is to help the family , you can visit them and travel them to do other assignments ​ — food , care , or help to prepare a funeral arrangement .
These activities can be more likely than what you say .
At times , you may find opportunities to express some good things about the weak , such training can bring joy to the grief .
For example , Pam lost her husband over six years ago .
She says : “ At times , people often tell me some good things that my husband did not know , and this makes me happy . ”
Scholars realize that people can help grieving ones when they are weak , but then everyone forgets them .
So it would be wise to comfort the mourning .
* Many grieving ones want this to help them to reduce their grief .
Consider the example of Kaori , a young sister in Japan , who was deeply distressed by her mother .
About three months later , her mother died .
Happily , her loyal ones comforted her .
One of her friends named Ritsuko grew her greatly .
The woman agreed to be her friend , Kaori said : “ I did not want that .
But the way the woman treated me made me very close to her .
Each week we go to meetings and in the ministry together .
It invites me to drink together and brings food and to me in letters , letters , and secre@@
I was very helpful . ”
For 12 years , Kaori and her husband were preaching for 70 hours each month .
Kaori relates : “ It continues to care for me .
I also visited her and enjoyed associating with her when I returned home . ”
Another example is that of one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Cyprus , Poli , also benefited from the help she received .
The Poli husband , Sozos , was a good man who invited the widows and widows to his home to get involved or eat .
Sadly , though , Sozos was about 53 years old and died in a cruel disease .
There , they continued to associate with Jehovah’s Witnesses .
Poli relates : “ The minds we received here do not know what has happened to us and the difficult circumstances we live .
Yet , they went to us and to help us .
What a delight it was when my son Daniel was surrounding his father !
The elders in our congregation helped Daniel greatly .
There was one of them who invited Daniel whenever he invited his friends to engage in homes or to produce a ball . ”
Poli and her son serve Jehovah faithfully today .
Of course , there are many ways in which we can help the grief and comfort them .
The resurrection hope that the Bible speaks gives us great encouragement .
Some may write a few days in their words to keep in mind when they need to comfort the weak .
Remember the woman mentioned earlier , Gail and her husband , who felt that she could not stop her husband’s grief , Rob .
However , she wanted to see her husband resurrected as God promised .
I felt compassion for those who mourn but did not know that promise . ”
Soon when the earth will be a paradise , God will resurrect Job and many who remain faithful .
Acts 24 : 15 confirmed this , saying : “ There will be a resurrection . ”
Jesus too said : “ Do not be surprised at this , for the hour is coming , where all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out . ”
What will happen to all faithful servants of God on earth .
If a loved one dies , there is no wonder what we have discussed will not cause you to stop the wilderness .
But meditating on the Bible’s promise will help you to maintain a hope and strength to keep living . ​ — 1 Thessalonians 4 : 13 .

WHEN THE BIBLE OF THE BIBLE OF THE BIBLE ?
“ God . . . will wipe out every tear from their eyes , and death will be no more . ” ​ — Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 .
This article of The Watchtower discusses how God will fulfill his promises and how we can benefit .
COVER SUBJECT | WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN ?
Jesus was killed in 33 C.E .
He was said that he was blasphemed , so he was threatened and was formed on a stake .
But God resurrected him from death and 40 days later , Jesus returned to heaven .
We find this account from the Gospel of the Greek Scriptures that often called the New Testament .
But if it is true , humans have hope and can share that hope with others .
Is the Gospel accounts true or thoroughly impressed ?
The Gospel is not a false story , the experiences in it really happened .
For example , many of the names mentioned are true because there are still those places .
They spoke of people who were real , and they were in harmony with the names of history . ​ — Luke 3 : 1 , 2 , 23 .
The writers who lived in the first century also spoke of Jesus .
* The Gospel Gospel accounts about how Jesus was killed in harmony with the Roman punishment
In addition , the events mentioned above occurred , and the deaf and other disciples of Jesus were
These things assure us that the Gospel writers spoke the truth and what they said about Jesus was right .
Though many believe that Jesus lived on earth and died , others did not accept his resurrection from death .
His disciples did not agree when they were first told that Jesus was resurrected from death .
But they stopped doubting when they and other disciples saw Jesus at times .
On one occasion , over 500 people saw him . ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 6 .
Jesus ’ disciples courageously declared people , including those who killed him that Jesus was resurrected from death .
Would these disciples be confident that Jesus was resurrected ?
Clearly , the assurance that Jesus was raised from death makes them not discouraged in the past and today .
There is evidence that the account of Jesus ’ death and resurrection from the Gospel occurred .
If you read this account effectively , you can be confident that these events really happen .
You can gain further confidence if you understand why these events happen .
Tacitus , born in about 55 , said that “ Christ , from his name , suffered greatly in the hands of Pontius Pilate under Tiberius rule . ”
Suetonius ( in the first century ) also mentions Jesus ’ name ; and a Jewish writer named Josephus ( first century ) ; and Pliny Miny Minor , the governor of Bithynia ( first century ) .
Second , Jesus ’ enemies would want to write information that would indicate that he was real .
Speaking of Jesus ’ resurrection , Peter explains : “ God raised him up on the third day , giving him to be revealed , not to all the people , but to the witnesses that God has already chosen , that we have eaten with him after his resurrection . ”
The Gospel of Matthew says that when Jesus ’ enemies learned that he was raised from death , they tried to avoid spreading the account . ​ — Matthew 28 : 11 - 15 .
Does this mean that Jesus did not want people to know that he was resurrected ?
No , for Peter said : “ He commanded us to preach to the people and to bear witness and that is the One whom God has appointed him the Judge of the living and the dead . ”
That is what true Christians do . ​ — Acts 10 : 42 .
“ Sin entered into the world through one man [ Adam ] death through sin . ” ​ — Romans 5 : 12 .
If someone said to you , “ Would you like to live forever ? ”
No doubt , many would say yes , but they would feel that this would never be possible .
Death is common in today’s world , some say that it is a wall .
But what answer would you ask , “ Would you like to die ? ”
No doubt many would say no .
The Bible shows that God created humans with a desire to live .
He said that God ‘ makes everlasting life in our heart . ’ ​ — Ecclesiastes 3 : 11 .
Today , however , people do not live forever .
Does God take action to solve our problems ?
The Bible answers are encouraging and show why Jesus suffered and died .
The book of Genesis chapters of three chapters explains that God created Adam and Eve , gave them the privilege of living forever and gave them the laws that would walk to continue enjoying this life .
Thereafter , the book explains how they disobeyed God and lost that privilege .
The Bible speaks of direct story , and some say that it is a storm .
But the book of Genesis is like the Gospel because the accounts in him are true .
What was the result of Adam’s disobedience ?
The Bible says : “ Sin entered into the world through one man [ Adam ] death through sin , and then death spread to all men because they all sinned . ”
He lost his life forever and eventually died .
We inherited sin from him because we are his sons .
Is there any step that God has taken to solve this problem ?
God made arrangements to free people from inherited sin and have the opportunity to live forever .
Romans 6 : 23 states that the result of “ sin is death . ”
This indicates that death is the result of sin .
Similarly , we sin and have the result of sin ​ — death .
We were born in this situation , even though we did not have a wrong course .
But God loved us and sent his Son , Jesus , to eliminate the effects of “ sin . ”
Jesus ’ death gives us the opportunity to live forever
As one man , Adam caused us to sin and death by disobedience , one perfect man is needed to remain faithful until death to save us from the consequences of sin .
The Bible explains : “ Just as many peoples became sinners of one man , so the obedience of one man will be brought to many righteous ones . ”
He left the heavens , became a perfect man * and died for us .
We have the opportunity to have a good relationship with God and to live forever in the future .
Why must Jesus die to accomplish that ?
Would the Almighty God not express that all Adam’s offspring would live forever ?
God is following his righteous standards in this regard , but people can think if God will follow this principle in some matters .
For example , would he follow this principle in knowing humans worthy of everlasting life ?
Will he fulfill his promises ?
Since God is following this principle to assure us that we receive salvation , it shows that he will continue to do what is right .
God used Jesus ’ ransom to give us the opportunity to gain everlasting life in Paradise on earth .
Consider the words found at John 3 : 16 : “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - begotten Son , that everyone exercising faith in him may not be destroyed but have everlasting life . ”
Jesus ’ death indicates that God follows his righteous standards and loves people deeply .
Why , though , did Jesus suffer and die as revealed in the Gospels ?
As Jesus faced serious suffering and remained faithful , he showed that what Satan said that people would not remain faithful to God if they faced difficult circumstances .
It is as if Satan said the truth when he made Adam , the perfect man , sinned .
However , Jesus , the perfect man , remained faithful despite the difficult circumstances he faced .
Doing so shows that Adam was loyal to him if he wanted to do so .
Jesus set a fine example for us by coping with problems .
God blessed Jesus for his obedience by giving him immortal life in heaven .
He said : “ This means everlasting life , knowing you , the only true God and the one whom you sent , Jesus Christ . ” ​ — John 17 : 3 .

God eliminated Jesus ’ life from heaven to Mary’s mother and God’s holy spirit protected Jesus so that he could not inherit imperfection from Mary . ​ — Luke 1 : 31 , 35 .
On the last night before Jesus died , he gathered his faithful disciples and set an obligation to remember his death .
He said to them : “ Keep doing this in remembrance of me . ”
Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide follow this command by attending meetings each year to remember Jesus ’ death .
That year , Jesus ’ death on Sunday , March 23 , 2016 , after sundown .

THE Devil . . .
The evil in the heart of people ?
The Devil discussed Jesus and ‘ tried ’ him .
In the past , the Devil was a faithful angel , but he “ did not stand on the truth . ”
He became a liar and rebelled against God .
Some angels supported Satan . ​ — Revelation 12 : 9 .
The Devil blinds many so that they do not know that he exists . ​ — 2 Corinthians 4 : 4 .
WHEN people are eye , others fear in the hands of wicked spirits .
“ The whole world is at the hands of the wicked one . ”
The Devil is influenced by people , but this does not mean that he has authority over any human .
The Devil is misleading people to do his will . ​ — 2 Corinthians 11 : 14 .
At times , wicked spirits may seize a person and cause them to do their will . ​ — Matthew 12 : 22 .
With God’s help , you can succeed in “ opposing the Devil . ” ​ — James 4 : 7 .

At a convention , a brother asked me if I would like to preach .
When we arrived in the territory where we would preach , he gave me some books on God’s Kingdom and said to me : “ Go to the people there , and I will do in this reward . ”
In addition , a sister used the book The Harp of God to teach us the Bible .
During my youth , I enjoyed teaching people God’s Word so that I wanted to hope .
The brother came from his room and told me to stay on a secretary .
He said : “ Who has given you the power to judge someone as a prison ?
Let us continue to preach with joy and let Jehovah judge people . ”
Another brother taught me that we sometimes need to cope with problems if we want to be happy when we preach .

After three weeks , I spoke to her that I wanted to marry , and we got married six weeks later .
My wife and I were assigned to serve as missionaries in Puerto Rico , so I had no opportunity to enter the new ark .
For example , in Potala Pastillo , there are two families who have many children , and I have a basis for self - control .
I asked one of the small children named Hilda , even if she wanted to share in the ministry .
We sold her , and she joined us in the ministry .
She wanted to go to a place where she was assigned to Ecuador , and she asked us : “ Do you see
I was a single girl who had no sword from Pastillo . ”
First , Lennart Johnson and I were most of the work .
Nathan Knorr , who was taking the lead then came to Puerto Rico .
Eventually , he was so distracted that I would have a good career and said that he did not enjoy what happened .
My father did not begin to serve Jehovah when my mother and I began to do so .
Maxine died in 2011 .
I look forward to seeing her when she raised from death .
After 60 years of service in the area where I was on the sea , I felt that I became a party .
Some who visited me wanted to discuss their problems or family problems .
Each Bethel service is vital .
Whenever we serve Jehovah , we have the opportunity to praise him .

Once elders hear that refugees entered , they would be wise to apply the counsel found in the Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will , chapter 8 paragraph 30 .

“ My children are following the truth , ” says 3 JOHN 4 .

When your children see that you “ seek first ” God’s Kingdom , they will help them to learn how to rely on Jehovah for their needs .

How can children benefit from learning their parents ’ language ?
If so , would you strive to learn some of the children in your country ?
The same is true of children who are not able to speak their parents , and do they not need to be done so ?
If you are in such a situation , you can still teach your children about Jehovah and love him .
How can parents help children who need to study in two languages ?
( a ) Who has the responsibility to choose family meetings to attend ?
But that is not possible if children do not understand the language well .
( Read 1 Corinthians 14 : 9 , 11 . )
And we see that the solution of this problem is to move to the local congregation , but that is not easy .
Yet , we moved to the congregation .
Now we share in the ministry and attend the meetings together , and we invite the brothers from the congregation to eat together .
Doing such things helped our children to know the brothers and to make Jehovah a father and a friend .
To us this is more important than learning our language . ”
Samuel adds : “ To continue to be friends of Jehovah , my wife and I attended meetings in our language .
Now three of our children serve Jehovah and serve as full - time ministers . ”
Kristina relates : “ I know some things in my parents ’ language , but what was said at the convention I did not understand .
Young ones , do you feel that you need to move to a congregation where you understand ?

Love God’s Word ( See paragraph 14 )
On Jesus ’ last night on earth , he told his disciples : “ I give you a new commandment , love one another , just as I have loved you , that you also love one another .
By this all will understand you as my disciples , if you have love among yourselves . ” ​ — John 13 : 34 , 35 .

GARY says : “ In our congregation there were two pioneers who said .
Some in the congregation were discouraged . ”
“ Through no suggestion , purposes separate . ”
Michael says : “ My brother forgave me with all his heart . ”
“ Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely if anyone has a word about another . ”
Now they prepare for one another and share in the ministry together .
We may feel that this difference is not something else , but it can cause problems . ”
I took action to change my attitude , and I prayed to Jehovah about the matter .
I replied to the sister and wrote her a letter to apologize for my injustice .
We were corrupted and embraced one another . ”
MANY today make money ahead .

And often when they begin to pray for the loss of what they say , but if they continue to know what to say .
Their love for their faith and their expressions of concern for me is very encouraging . ”
That is why it is wise to continue to encourage them after that , the Bible says : “ Love always does , and a brother has been born for times of distress . ”

Such help strengthens me . ”

One of my students began attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall .
For example , Jacob , from the United States , says : “ When I was seven years old , many of our classmates were Vietnam and speak their language .
Because I wanted to teach them about Jehovah , I decided to learn their language .
And what I did to learn the language is to study the English Watchtower and English - speaking edition .
I also looked for friends in the local congregation .
When I was 18 , I began pioneering .
Later , I was invited to attend the Bible School for Marriage Brothers .

If I went to the ministry , they listened to me and agreed to study the Bible with them .
Some of them were baptized . ” ​ — Compare A .
2 : 7 , 8 .
I enjoy encouraging the brothers in our congregation and are happy to see their spiritual progress .
After attending the Bible School for Marriage , I was assigned to serve .

Here Africa , I went to build various Kingdom Halls .
We stay with a Bible study together and work together .
I also enjoyed preaching with the local brothers each week .
My goal when I was a child makes me happy in ways I had never seen . ”
Serving at Bethel makes a person happy because all the work being done there is Jehovah .

But I asked myself , ‘ How can I imitate Jesus when I dealt with this woman ? ’
After thinking about what Jesus would do , I decided to forgive her .
Sometimes later , I felt that this woman was struggling with a sickness and was very distressed .
I realized that she may have written what she had not intended to hurt me , but the situation she was in her womb made her .
Meditating on Jesus ’ example when he was angry helped me not to become angry with my workmate , but I love her . ”
When he came to earth , “ he poured himself to take the image of a slave ” in behalf of us “ until death . ”
STUDY : If we ‘ be patient with one another in love ’ we will help us to maintain “ peace ” with one another .

At first , I did not accept that view .
I feel that Jehovah will never love me .
“ But some days later I read a scripture that changed my thinking .
I felt that Jehovah was telling me : ‘ Come to Vicky to be setled with one another .
I know you , and I know your sins , yet I love you . ’
“ I could not sleep on that day .

Some years ago , Jesus told his followers that they needed to flee from Jerusalem and after seeing the soldiers surrounded her . ​ — Luke 21 : 20 - 24 .
For 28 years , Jesus warned his followers .
At that time , the Christians in Israel remained faithful despite opposition and trial .
But Paul wanted to prepare them for the future .
( Read Hebrews 10 : 36 - 39 . )
Hence , Jehovah directed Paul to write to these dear brothers .
This letter was written , now called the Hebrew book to encourage them because of what would happen .

What will we now consider ?
After the apostle Paul urged you to “ continue loving fellow believers , ” he said what can help Christians to do so .
What does it mean to be generous ?
“ Love is not forgotten to strangers . ”
This expression may have reminded us of Abraham and Lot .
These two men showed kindness to strangers who did not know them .
We can invite our brothers to come to our home to eat or encourage one another .
We do not need to stop several food or to spend more money .
It is wrong to invite those who want to be kind to us in the future .
How important it is that we should not let our affairs cause us to forget hospitality !
How can we “ keep in mind those in prison ” ?

This courage can help us to maintain a proper view .
How can we increase our love for the elders ?

We are deeply grateful when we remember what they do .
Instead , we want to be willing to obey .
In that way , we see “ their bloodguilt in love for their work . ” ​ — 1 Thessalonians 5 : 13 .
Do you appreciate the work that elders do in our behalf ?
How can we maintain our love for fellow believers ?
Jehovah’s people around the world are known with brotherly love
The same was true in Paul’s day .
Yes , there are many ways to show our love for our brothers !
So in this year , when we enter the Kingdom Hall and see the yeartext for a year , let us meditate on these questions : Would I become more hospitable or hospitable ?
What will help me to be content ?
How can I become more obedient to those taking the lead ?
If we improve the way we are in these six places , the yeartext will not be written only to us , but he will remind us of Paul’s counsel when he said : “ Continue loving the brothers . ” ​ — Hebrews 13 : 1 .

This slave should show compassion for the other slave as the king showed compassion .
The king was deeply angry when he learned that the slave did not forgive his fellow worshipper .
Do I forgive you all the debt so that you may ask me , and it does not improve you to be compassionate to your fellow worshipper , just as I have compassed you ? ”
Like that king , Jehovah forgave us much debt .
What should love for Jehovah and his feelings move us to do ?

Read Acts 2 : 2 - 4 .

How do we know that the situation affected Christians differ ?
Something like fire came down on each of them .
Jehovah gave them the gift of a foreign language .
In fact , they are anointed with holy spirit .
For example , the Bible does not say that something like fire came down on thousands of baptized people and were anointed in Jerusalem on the day .
Some Samaritans became anointed soon after their baptism .
Another wonder , Cornelius and those in his home were anointed before baptism . ​ — Acts 10 : 44 - 48 .
What do all anointed ones receive , and how does this affect them ?
Christians recognize that God’s dealings with them differ greatly .
Some recognize that Jehovah has affected them .
Thus , Jehovah uses holy spirit to make sure that those Christians choose to go to heaven .
What must each anointed Christian do to receive his heavenly reward ?
Peter explains : “ For this reason , brothers and sisters can make your calling and choices , for if you do these things , you will not stumble , for this will be given you abundant support to the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . ”

Jehovah has already used his power ​ — holy spirit — ​ to show them clear that they are anointed !
What kind of thinking might a Christian have , but what confidence does he have ?
When Christians are anointed with holy spirit , it changes their circumstances .
The wind goes to the place he purposes , listening to his car , but you do not know where he is coming and where he will not be born from spirit . ”

But he was convinced that Jehovah had chosen him and had no doubt .
He was happy and grateful for that privilege .

Do you see that Jehovah has given you good results in preaching the good news ?
Do you love people from your heart and feel that it is your responsibility to help them serve Jehovah ?
What experiences in your life show you that Jehovah has helped you ?

This “ Jew ” represents those whom God anointed with holy spirit .
They are also called “ the Israel of God . ”
But Jesus said that all would be “ one flock ” and follow him as “ one shepherd . ”
( 3 ) If someone in our congregation begins eating bread and drinking wine at the Memorial , how should I treat him ?
( 4 ) Should I be concerned when I see the number of people partaking of the bread and drinking wine at the Memorial increases ?
Why can we not know those who will be in 144,000 ?
Because no one can know whether these will have their reward .
Jehovah is the final sealing and does so before they die or the beginning of “ the great tribulation . ” ​ — Revelation 2 : 10 ; 7 : 3 , 14 .

Jehovah’s holy spirit helps his servants to be humble .
Hence , anointed ones do not feel that they are more than others .
They do not feel that they can understand Bible teachings more fully than anyone else .
What do anointed Christians not expect to be done , and why ?
They knew that Jehovah did not tell everyone when he anointed them with holy spirit , so the anointed would not be surprised if others did not believe that he was anointed .
As anointed ones do not expect people to respect him more than others , he will not tell the people he met with them that he was anointed with holy spirit .
Anointed Christians do not see that they should be with other anointed ones , as if they are part of a group .
They would not seek some anointed ones to discuss their role as anointed ones , or they met to study the Bible alone .
Why do you need to be careful about how you treat those who partake of the bread and drink wine at the Memorial ?
( See the box entitled : “ Love Is Not Sacrifice . ” )
How should you treat anointed brothers ?
Jesus told his disciples : “ You are all brothers . ”
He continued to say : “ Everyone who will glorify himself will be humbled ; and everyone humbling himself will glorify . ”
So it would be wrong to show honor to a person , even though he is anointed .
But that is because they work hard in speaking “ with teaching , ” not because they are anointed with holy spirit .
How should you treat the one partaking of the bread and drinking wine at the Memorial ?
( See paragraphs 9 - 11 )
How can we show that we respect anointed Christians ?
How can we show that we respect those whom Jehovah has anointed with holy spirit ?
We should not ask them how they became anointed .
Moreover , we should not think that their husbands , wives , or relatives are anointed .
This privilege was not an inheritance .
We need to avoid asking questions that can hurt others .
We can be sure that in Jehovah’s new world , Jehovah will “ satisfy every living thing . ” ​ — Psalm 145 : 16 .
How do we protect ourselves if we avoid becoming more interested in others than we should do ?
We can protect ourselves if we avoid showing respect for the anointed more than other brothers .
Thus , if we avoid being attracted to others more than we should , including those who have been anointed with holy spirit , prominent , or longtime servants of Jehovah , they will not influence us when they are unfaithful or disloyal to the congregation .
Instead , we can maintain faith and continue to serve Jehovah . ​ — Jude 16 .
Why should we not be concerned about the number of people who eat bread and drink wine at the Memorial ?
Years later , the number of people who partake of the bread and drink wine were lost .
In recent times , the number has grown .
“ Jehovah knows those who belong to him . ”
Thus , the number includes people who feel that they are anointed but that Jehovah does not affect them .
Others may have a problem that affects their thinking and feel that they will rule with Christ in heaven .
Of course , we cannot know the primary number of anointed ones on earth .
What does the Bible say about the number of anointed ones on earth when the great tribulation begins ?
The anointed will be in various places around the world during Jesus ’ coming to go with them
The Bible says that Jesus would “ send his angels with a great increase , and they will gather his chosen ones from four corners from the end of the heavens to this end . ”
In addition , the Bible indicates that in the last days , a few anointed ones will reduce the earth .
But he did not say the number of anointed ones who would reduce when the great tribulation begins .
What do we need to know about the 144,000 anointed ones whom Jehovah chose ?
For thousands of years later , most people who claim to be Christians did not really follow Christ’s teachings .
Yet , in these years , Jehovah has anointed a few Christians who followed Christ’s teachings .
Jesus described these Christians with wheat who grew up with the weeds or the weeds .
In the last days , Jehovah continued to select the 144,000 anointed ones .
So if God decided that he would choose some of the present system of things , we know that he is doing what is right .
A few anointed Christians in the first century wrote Matthew to Revelation .
Today , only a few anointed ones have the responsibility to provide for God’s people “ food at the proper time . ”
He expects them to obey one command and and to remain faithful .
All of them must remain faithful , serving him together and be united .
[ 2 ] ( paragraph 15 ) Acts 2 : 33 indicates that Jesus was involved in anointing a person with holy spirit , but Jehovah chooses the man .
When we disappoint others and show them that we do not respect them , we are “ disappointed . ”
Rather , if we love our brothers , we think about their feelings before we speak or do something .
We show that we respect those taking the lead in Jehovah’s organization by our dealings with them .
Of course , we want to respect them and their wives , and this is good .
But if we welcome these brothers , do we have something we do to show that we do not respect them ?
Though we enjoy meeting and communicating with the brothers who visit us , we should not treat them as people treat the music .
For example , we should not view their reports without permission , whether they eat or when doing something .
Should we send people and persevere that we view the report ?
How do you think such a attitude would affect those who attended a convention at the first time ?
Instead , we will show that we understand why they visit us and their hard work in our behalf .
What will help us to determine how to treat our brothers ?
First , we remember that Jehovah alone should give glory .
Second , we remember that we value these brothers and their wives but should not glorify them as the stars of music .
These brothers want to treat them as our brothers .
If we apply these principles , we will show that we truly love our brothers and sisters and will not “ lose sight of mind . ”
The ten men would “ go together ” with Jew : The other sheep serve Jehovah along with these anointed Christians but do not think that the anointed are their leaders , and they do not commend them or honor them more than modest .
Rather , the other sheep love the anointed and respect them as their brothers
“ We work with him , asking you not to accept God’s undeserved kindness . ” ​ — 2 CORINTHIANS 6 : 1 .
makes us happy ?
Does it draw us closer to God and others ?
Although Jehovah is the Universal Sovereign , what privilege has he given mankind ?
JEHOVAH is the Most High and created everything .
He also had wisdom and power .
He helped Job to understand this , so Job said : “ I know that you have the power to do all things , not the one who can prevent you from doing what you pursue . ”
Jehovah can do everything he wants without help .
But because he loved us , he invited us to work with him to accomplish his purpose .
What important assignment did Jehovah give Jesus to do ?
Jehovah gave his Son the privilege of working with him in creating all things .
What did Jehovah tell Adam to do , and why ?
Jehovah invited humans to work with him .
For example , he gave Adam the assignment to animals .
What a joy it must have been to do so !
He noticed the image of the animal and their conduct and gave each appropriate name .
How did some work with God to accomplish his purpose ?
Later , God invited some to work with him .
Noah built an ark who delivered him and his family during the Flood .
Moses liberated the nation of Israel from Egypt .
Joshua led the Israelites into the Promised Land .
Solomon built the temple in Jerusalem .
All these faithful men and many have worked with Jehovah to accomplish his purpose .
What assignment does Jehovah give us the privilege of doing , or does he need to help him in this work ?
Today , Jehovah invites us to do our best to support his Kingdom .
There are many ways in which we can serve God .
In addition , Jesus said that Jehovah could cause mountains to tell people about the King and his Kingdom .
The apostle Paul said : “ We work with him and ask you not to accept God’s undeserved kindness . ”
Yes , working with God is a great privilege .
Let us see some reasons why this makes us happy .
How did God’s first Son describe his feelings when he worked with his Father ?
Working with God brings joy to Jehovah’s servants .
When Jesus worked with his Father , he rejoiced because he accomplished many things and knew that Jehovah loved him .
Why does preaching the good news bring us joy ?
Jesus said that we are happy when we give gifts and when someone gives us a gift .
How happy we are when we start serving God , but why do we rejoice when we preach the good news to others ?
We are happy when we see that they have changed their thinking and lifestyle .
The preaching of the good news is the most important work and satisfying work we do to make it possible for those who become God’s friends to gain everlasting life . ​ — 2 Corinthians 5 : 20 .
What do some say that they are happy to work with Jehovah ?
This makes us happy .
Marco , who lives in Italy , says : “ I am so happy to know that I do my best to serve Jehovah because he does not forget my work . ”
Similarly , Franco , who serves in Italy , says : “ By means of his Word and other things he provides , Jehovah reminds us that he loves us every day and everything we are important , even though we feel that this is not important .
That is why working with God makes me happy and makes my life meaningful . ”
What relationship exists between Jehovah and Jesus , and why ?
Jesus worked with Jehovah for decades .
Jesus explained how their relationship was when he said : “ My Father and I were one of my Father . ”
Yes , they are united and worked together without problem
Why does the preaching work draw us closer to God and others ?
He prayed : “ To be one like us . ”
We can learn why it is appropriate to trust in Jehovah and to apply his principles .
And God will draw close to us if we draw close to him .
( Read James 4 : 8 . )
We draw close to our brothers because we face trials and experiences that bring joy to our brothers .
We work , joy , and cope with problems .
Octavia , a sister in Britain , says : “ Working with Jehovah draws me closer to people . ”
She explains that she now has a friendship with people depends on their goals and their goal that is right to her own .
Of course , we too have a similar view .
When we see our efforts to please Jehovah , we draw close to them .
Why can we draw close to Jehovah and our brothers in the new world ?
We love God and our brothers now , but we will love them in the new world .
Imagine the satisfying work we will do in the future !
We will work to make the earth a paradise .
All humans will draw close to one another and Jehovah , who will “ satisfy every living thing . ” ​ — Psalm 145 : 16 .
We need to protect our relationship with Jehovah , for we live in Satan’s world and are imperfect .
Therefore , we must do our utmost to move to another area .
Similarly , we need to strive to avoid Satan’s influence .
How does the preaching work protect us ?
When we talk about Jehovah and the Bible , we focus on things that are important and good , not things that cause our relationship with God .
How did one Witness in Osteustralia feel about preaching ?
We protect ourselves if we are busy in the ministry , study , and sharing in the ministry with our brothers , so we can stop anxiety about our problems .
Preaching helps me to be humble ; it makes me trust in Jehovah and for our brothers . ”
Why do our persistence in the ministry show that God’s spirit is with us ?
Preaching helps us to be confident that God’s spirit is with us .
For example , imagine that you have been assigned to distribute people in your territory a bread
You are not celebrated , and you will spend the money of your goals so that you can reach this goal .
In addition , most people do not want the bread , some even hate you to bring them this goal .
Would you have been doing this work long ?
However , we continue to preach without debt , even though we use our resources , our time , and people ridicule others and angry us .
This shows that God’s spirit is with us .
How does preaching the good news affect God’s purpose for mankind ?
It is God’s purpose for mankind to live forever and does not change his purpose when humans have sinned .
God arranged for us to be freed from sin and death .
Jesus came to earth and gave his life a sacrifice .
If we preach to people and help them to become God’s friends today , we work directly to God in his arrangement to save mankind from sin and death .
How is preaching related to God’s most important instructions ?
When we help people to gain everlasting life , we show that we love them and Jehovah .
It is God’s will that “ all men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth . ”
When a Pharisee asked Jesus the most important instructions , Jesus said : “ You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind .
How do you feel about the privilege of preaching the good news ?
In addition , this work gives us the opportunity to show our love for God and for others .
Jehovah has millions of people around the world , and the situation is different .
I also teach you and give you instruction at the right time . ’
What a privilege it is to do the work Jehovah has given us and work with our God ! ”
We work with God when we preach to others and help them to become God’s friends to live forever .
Though God can do this , he invites us to work with him because he loves us .
In the first article , we will learn a lesson from Abraham’s example .
In the second article , we will learn lessons from the examples of Ruth , Hezekiah , and Mary , Jesus ’ mother .
In these articles , we will consider some Bible accounts about King David and others who lived in his day .
As we discuss these accounts , we will learn how we can remain loyal to Jehovah even though it is difficult to do so .
26 HISTORY ​ — Jehovah Leads to His Ministry
30 Keep On Serving Jehovah Happily
I told myself that I had been thrown into prison for refusing to enter the military .
I asked him , “ Will you release me in prison ? ”
I WAS born in 1926 , in Crooksville , Ohio , U.S.A .
Our parents were not spiritually - minded but encouraged us to attend the church .
I attended a church named Methodist .
When I was 14 years old , the church gave me a gift to spend a year in Sunday church .
Margaret Walker ( the second sister from left ) helped me to learn about Jehovah
At that time , Margaret Walker began visiting my mother and preached her from the Bible .
One day I stayed with them when they studied but asked me to go outside because she felt that I would drop them .
But I did my best to listen to what they said .
Sometimes later , Margaret asked me , “ Do you know God’s name ? ”
“ Everyone knows that God is his name . ”
“ Go to see Psalm 83 : 18 in the Bible . ”
When I looked , I felt that God’s name was Jehovah .
I went out to my friends and told them , “ If you go home today , see Psalm 83 : 18 in the Bible to see God’s name . ”
So I began preaching .
I studied the Bible and got baptized in 1941 .
Shortly thereafter , I was asked to start conducting congregation studies .
I encouraged my mother and my brothers to come to the meetings and began attending .
But my father did not want that .
I was entrusted in the congregation and received many publications published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
One day , my father showed me my conversation , saying : “ Do you see these things ?
I did not want them in that house and leave my house . ”
My father tried to stop my mother from attending meetings .
On one occasion , if she will go to meetings , he will follow her away and guide her home .
But my mother would flee and go to the meeting .
I told my mother : “ You are anxious , and he will inherit you . ”
I went to a soldier in Fort Hayes in Columbus , Ohio , and I made some trials and filled a footnote .
I told the answers that I would not enter the soldier .
But a few days later , a phonography came to my home and said , “ Corwin Robison , I was assigned to arrest you . ”
Two weeks later , we went to court and the judge said : “ I am the one that I will give you the lifetime .
Do you have something else ? ”
I replied : “ He the Great , I would like to be viewed as a preacher .
I preach from house to house and preach to many people about God’s Kingdom . ”
The judge then told the 12 judges present : “ You do not come to decide whether this man is a preacher or not .
You are here to tell us whether he agrees to enter the military or not . ”
In 30 minutes , the judges judged that I had a wrong course .
I was sentenced to five years in prison in Ashland , Kentucky .
My first two weeks in prison in Columbus , Ohio , I did not go outside .
I prayed to Jehovah : “ I will not spend five years in prison .
The next day , I left me outside .
I went to a prisoner , and he was a young man , and we stood to watch from the shore .
He asked me , “ What do you do here ? ”
“ I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses . ”
He said , “ Is it really ?
What , then , do you do here ? ”
“ Jehovah’s Witnesses do not go to war and do not kill . ”
He said , “ They kept you in prison because you refused to kill .
“ No , ” I said .
He said , “ I spent 15 years in a prison , and there I read some of your publications . ”
When I heard that , I prayed and said , “ Jehovah made this man a helper . ”
So I had no problem with 50 prisoners in that area .
I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses who were imprisoned in Ashland , Kentucky because they refused to share in war
The soldiers led me to a prison in Ashland .
There I met some mature brothers .
A brother who is preparing us to preach territory .
He would tell me : “ Robison , you would preach to those who were given this inheritance and that altar .
It is your territory .
In that way , we preached in prison .
After World War I in 1945 , I stayed in a temporary prison .
I said , “ This is good but I will not enter the military . ”
I quoted 2 Timothy 2 : 3 and said , “ I am the war of the Christ . ”
“ Go ! ”
Shortly thereafter , I attended meetings for Bethel service at a convention in Cincinci , Ohio .
Brother Milton Henschel told us that zealous brothers were needed at Bethel .
So I was filled with the ark and was invited .
At Bethel , I worked hard .
For several years , I worked in the chaste camp and where the branch was built .
In addition , I worked as an inhabitants , armists , and at New York Assembly Hall@@
I wanted the work done at Bethel , such as morning worship , family study , and preaching with the congregation I attended .
Of course , that is what the family of Jehovah’s Witnesses should do .
If parents and children discuss the daily scriptures , they regularly share in the congregation activities and enthusiastically share in the preaching work and enthusiastically contribute to the family
I have many friends at Bethel and in the congregation .
But all of Jehovah’s servants are imperfect , including those serving at Bethel .
If I have a problem with a brother , I try to see that we are corrected .
Now it was not easy to preach from house to house to house , but I did not give up .
I learned Mannight of Caina and enjoyed preaching to Caina on the street .
At times in the morning , I offered 30 or 40 magazines to people .
I preach to Caina in Brooklyn in New York
I once spoke to a Bible in Chinina !
One day , a good girl smiled me and showed me the fruit of trees she gave .
I smiled her and gave her the Watchtower and Awake !
in Chinina .
She accepted and said that her name Katie .
Later , Katie came to my place and spoke to me whenever she saw me .
I taught her the names of some trees and garden trees in English and repeated the words after I told her .
In addition , I explained some of the Bible and accepted the book What Does the Bible Really Teach ?
But some weeks later , I did not see her .
Some months later , I gave a young girl who had been on the magazine and accepted .
The next week , she gave me a music and said , “ Speak with another in Chinese . ”
“ I don’t know everyone in Chinese . ”
But she persisted , so I accepted the text and said , “ My name Robison . ”
“ Robby , Katie , ” I heard the voice of
I now Caina . ”
Robby , who gave you a sister .
Please teach her how you teach me . ”
I replied , “ Katie , I can do my best .
I thank you that you tell me where you are . ”
Shortly thereafter , I spoke the final talk with Katie .
I hope that wherever two sisters are now , they will continue to learn about Jehovah .
For 73 years , I was happy that he helped me to fight and maintain my integrity when I was prison .
In addition , my brothers told me that I continued to serve Jehovah despite persecution that my father gave me great encouragement .
My father stopped persecuting us and attended our meetings before he died .
If God’s will is , our family and friends will be resurrected and live in the new world .

How did knowing Jehovah and his actions strengthen Abraham’s faith ?
What did Abraham do to strengthen his relationship with God ?
How can you imitate Abraham in developing a relationship with Jehovah ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) How do we know that humans can become God’s friends ?
WHEN we were born until the day of our death , we need to be shown love .
Humans need a close relationship and genuine friendships , not the kind of affection between a husband and wife .
Many do not believe that humans can develop a close relationship with Jehovah because he is the Most High and not seen .
We should imitate their example .
Consider the example of Abraham .
( Read James 2 : 23 . )
How did he become God’s friend ?
Abraham’s faith was so strong that he was known as “ the father of all believers . ”
As you examine his example , ask yourself , ‘ How can I imitate Abraham’s faith , and how can I strengthen my relationship with Jehovah ? ’
3 , 4 . ( a ) Describe what was the greatest test of faith that Abraham had ever experienced . ( b ) Why was Abraham ready to use Isaac as a sacrifice ?
Think of Abraham when he was about 125 years old when he strayed on the mountain gradually .
He was 25 years old .
Isaac contained a tree , and his father contained a loud and what he would use in fire .
He felt the weight that Jehovah told him to offer his son a sacrifice ! ​ — Genesis 22 : 1 - 8 .
This may have been the greatest test of faith that Abraham had touched my face .
Some people say that God had committed Abraham to offer his son a sacrifice to him .
Others say that Abraham was willing to do so because he did not love his son .
He knew that Jehovah would not tell him to do what would cause his life forever .
How did Abraham begin to know Jehovah and how did this knowledge affect him ?
Knowing Jehovah .
Abraham grew up in a city called Ur .
Shem was a man of faith and likely told his relatives about Jehovah .
How did Abraham’s experiences strengthen his faith ?
What Jehovah did .
Some think that a person has the idea of doing something , and it makes a person act .
The Bible refers to such a great ‘ fear of God . ’
We need to maintain godly fear if we want to cultivate a close relationship with him .
God told Abraham and Sarah to leave Ur and go to a land that they had never come .
Though Abraham knew that doing so would happen to many dangers , he obeyed Jehovah .
So Jehovah blessed him and protected him .
For example , Sarah was beautiful .
When she was burned from his hand and was nearly killed , Jehovah protected Abraham and Sarah through a miraculous way .
How can knowing Jehovah and experience what he has done strengthen our relationship with him ?
Like Abraham , we need to learn about Jehovah .
However , we too will have what we need to know about Jehovah and his works in the Bible .
Because we love Jehovah and respect him , we are moved to obey him .
When we do so , he will protect us and bless us .
9 , 10 . ( a ) What can strengthen the relationship between two people ?
( b ) What shows that Abraham appreciated his relationship with God and improved her ?
( Read Proverbs 17 : 17 . )
A close relationship is not like the obstacles used for dress .
He seems to be like a fine battle that requires water and care to grow .
Abraham appreciated his relationship with Jehovah and continued to improve her .
For example , when he traveled to Canaan with his family and his servants , he continued to obey Jehovah’s instructions in all his decisions .
About a year before Isaac was born when Abraham was 99 years old , Jehovah told him that he had been circumcised to all his men .
Did Abraham doubt Jehovah or sought an object to reject Jehovah’s instructions ?
Why was Abraham concerned about Sodom and Gomorrah , and how did Jehovah help him ?
For example , Abraham was concerned when Jehovah told him that he would destroy the city of Sodom and Gomorrah .
He was afraid that wicked people would be destroyed with good people .
He may have been concerned about his relatives Lot and his family who lived in Sodom .
Jehovah patiently dealt with his friend and showed him that he was merciful .
12 , 13 . ( a ) How did knowing Jehovah and experience what he did helped Abraham later ?
( b ) What shows that Abraham exercised faith in Jehovah ?
Knowing Jehovah and seeing how he helped Abraham to improve his relationship with Jehovah .
Before leaving his servants , Abraham said : “ Keep on dwelling with the wind and I and the young man and I will go there , worship , and return to you . ”
What did Abraham mean ?
When he said that they would return with Isaac , did he lie since he knew that he would sacrifice ?
The Bible says that Abraham knew that Jehovah could raise Isaac from death .
Abraham knew that she was Jehovah’s power and his wife , Sarah , despite their old age .
So he was convinced that nothing Jehovah could do .
Abraham did not know what would happen on that day .
Hence , Abraham was called “ the father of all believers . ”
What challenges do you face as you serve Jehovah , and how can Abraham’s example help you ?
At times , we cannot understand why Jehovah gave some instructions .
For some , the preaching work is very difficult .
They may feel embarrassed and heavy to speak to people who are not familiar with them .
If we meditate on the example of these faithful people , we will be moved to imitate them and draw closer to our great Friend , Jehovah . ​ — Hebrews 12 : 1 , 2 .
WHEN THE BIBLE OF THE BIBLE
Abraham and Sarah learned about Jehovah and began serving him
Abraham followed God’s command and and and left Ur
Jehovah protected Abraham and Sarah when traveling
REATION WORE
Abraham followed God’s command and and for all his circumcised household
Jehovah was patient with Abraham when he showed his concern for Sodom
Jehovah gave Abraham and Sarah a son
Abraham died with “ a beautiful old age , old age ”
Why can we be sure that Abraham did not know that he obeyed Jehovah ?
The Bible says that Abraham “ died in a beautiful old age , old age . ”
However , the Bible says that Abraham was “ old and old , ” who enjoyed life , does not mean that he had no hope for living in the future .
What joy could Abraham have on a paradise ?
The Bible says that Abraham was “ growing old in the city that was a man who was a Provider of God . ”
Abraham was confident that one day would see this city ​ — he would live in God’s Kingdom when he began ruling on earth .
In a paradise , he will realize that Jehovah’s restoration to him Isaac represents something important .
Furthermore , he will learn that his feelings as he prepare for the sacrifice of his son Isaac helped millions to understand how Jehovah felt when he gave his Son Jesus Christ as a sacrifice to mankind .
What are you determined to do , and what will we consider in the following article ?
May all of us be determined to imitate Abraham’s faith .
Like Abraham , we need to know Jehovah and experience what he has done in our behalf .
In the following article , we will consider three examples of faithful people who have developed a close relationship with God .
[ 1 ] ( paragraph 3 ) In the past , Abraham and Sarah were called Abram and Sarai .
In this article , however , we will use the names that Jehovah gave them later .
As we learn about him , we will begin to love him and respect him .
SONGS TO BE USED : 106 , 118
What lesson can we learn from Ruth’s friendship with Jehovah ?
Why did King Hezekiah become a close friend of Jehovah ?
What qualities made Mary , Jesus ’ mother , became a friend of Jehovah God ?
1 - 3 . ( a ) Why can we be confident that we can become God’s friends ?
( b ) Who will we consider in this article ?
THE Bible three times that Abraham was God’s friend .
Does that mean that he was the only friend of Jehovah ?
( Read Psalm 25 : 14 . )
They are among the “ great witnesses ” mentioned by the apostle Paul .
These people have various qualities , but all became God’s friends . ​ — Hebrews 12 : 1 .
What difficult decision did Ruth need to make , and why was it difficult to make ?
Naomi along with her mother , Ruth and Orpah traveled far away from Moab to Israel .
This situation caused Ruth to find herself in a difficult way .
Would she return to Moab to be with her relatives , or would she go to Naomi to Bethlehem ? ​ — Ruth 1 : 1 - 8 , 14 .
She could return to them , and they may have to care for her .
Naomi was afraid that she could not find a husband .
So Naomi told Ruth to return to Moab .
But Ruth refused to return to her people and false gods .
( a ) What wise decision did Ruth make ?
( b ) Why did Boaz ask Ruth to seek refuge under Jehovah ?
Ruth may have learned about Jehovah from her husband or from Naomi .
She learned that Jehovah was different from the gods of Moab .
She loved Jehovah and knew that he deserved to love him and serve him .
She told Naomi : “ Your love will become my relatives , and your God . ”
Boaz was impressed and praised her for her faith in Jehovah and ‘ seek refuge under his wings . ’
( Read Ruth 2 : 12 . )
Boaz ’ words remind us of how a bird sought refuge under his wings .
Similarly , Jehovah provided Ruth with refuge and blessed her for her faith .
Ruth did not regret her decision to serve Jehovah .
What can help those who hesitate to devote themselves to Jehovah ?
Many study the Bible , but they do not want to seek refuge in Jehovah .
They hesitate to devote themselves to Jehovah and get baptized .
If you find yourself in this situation , think of why you are hesitant .
Everyone has what he is serving him .
A wise decision to make is to serve the true God .
If you devote yourself to Jehovah , you show that you can be sure that he will help you .
He was born in a nation who served God .
Hezekiah’s father , Ahaz , was a bad man .
He did not honor God’s temple , and he influenced the people to worship false gods .
He also offered the brothers of Hezekiah to false gods by burning them in fire .
Yes , when Hezekiah was a boy , he experienced bad things ! ​ — 2 Kings 16 : 2 - 4 , 10 - 17 ; 2 Chronicles 28 : 1 - 3 .
9 , 10 . ( a ) Why might Hezekiah be quick to anger ?
( b ) Why should we not be angry with God ?
( c ) Why is it wrong to think that our moral conduct makes us good or wicked ?
Ahaz could cause his son Hezekiah to become angry with Jehovah .
Some today who do not experience what Hezekiah faced may feel that they have a strong reason to “ murmur against Jehovah ” or to become angry with his organization .
Some may feel that negative values of their household can cause them to do wrong things in their life or to do what their parents do .
Hezekiah’s life shows that this was not true !
Because he does not make bad things available to people .
Because Jehovah created us with the opportunity to do what we want , it means that we can choose to do good or bad .
Though their parents are not Jehovah’s Witnesses ( See paragraphs 9 , 10 )
Why was Hezekiah one of the best kings in Judah ?
Although his father was among the most bad kings of Judah , Hezekiah became one of good kings .
( Read 2 Kings 18 : 5 , 6 . )
He was moved to correct many wrong things that his father did .
He trusted in Jehovah that he would protect him and strengthen his people .
At times , Hezekiah showed pride , but when Jehovah corrected him , he humbled himself .
He did not allow the condition of their home to corrupt his life .
Like Hezekiah , how do many today become Jehovah’s friends ?
The world is filled with violence and lack of love , so many children today grow without loving parents and care for them .
Though many Christians today are from home and their householders , they choose to develop a close relationship with Jehovah .
Like Hezekiah , Hezekiah indicated that the training of their household would not show the kind of people who would live in
God gives us free will to choose what we want to do , and we can choose whether we can serve God and honor him , as Hezekiah did .
Why can we say that Mary’s assignment was not easy , yet what answer did she give to the angel Gabriel ?
She would have been born by the Son of God and died !
We spoke deeply about this great privilege given to Mary .
But there were some things that were not afraid .
How would she explain to Joseph that she did not treat him ?
What a privilege it was to raise God’s Son !
Why do we say that Mary had strong faith ?
How did Mary have such faith .
But we can cultivate faith like Mary and ask God for help .
What shows that Mary listened carefully ?
Mary was embarrassed .
The Bible says that “ everyone is swift about hearing and slow about speaking . ”
She set aside time to meditate on these important matters .
For example , when Jesus was born , shepherds told Mary a message given by an angel .
At all times , Mary was embarrassed , and she meditated on what she heard . ​ — Read Luke 2 : 16 - 19 , 49 , 51 .
What lesson can we learn from Mary’s speech ?
The Bible does not reveal what Mary spoke about .
Her statement is mentioned at Luke 1 : 46 - 55 .
Mary may have quoted about 20 times in her words .
In what ways can we imitate Mary’s faith ?
At times , Jehovah may give us a task that we see may find it difficult to do as he did to Mary .
May we imitate it , humbly accept the job and trust in Jehovah for help .
As we imitate faithful people mentioned in the Bible , what confidence can we have ?
Clearly , Ruth , Hezekiah , and Mary were close friends of Jehovah , such as Abraham .
IMAGINE the most important day in your life .
Was your first child born ?
Clearly , since the day of your baptism , many events in your worship have made you very happy .
What will help us to continue serving Jehovah with joy ?
Because Jehovah promised , his Kingdom will soon destroy this wicked system of things and bring an earthly paradise .
Zephaniah 1 : 14 states : “ The great day of Jehovah is near , and there is a great urgency , and the voice of the Lord’s day , a mighty man weeping in it . ”
If we see that the end will soon come , it can cause us to lose our joy as we did in the past .
If we associate with our brothers and sisters , we will be encouraged to continue serving Jehovah with joy .
The good qualities of Jehovah’s people may have brought us into true worship and make us joyful in our ministry .
What , though , can happen if others are disciplined because they reject God’s standards ?
A business program and technology in this world can cause us to purchase what we do not need .
Remember that Jesus said : “ Come to me , all you who are toiling and loaded down , and I will refresh you .
Take my yoke upon yourselves and learn from me , for I am mild - tempered and lowly in heart , and you will find refreshment to your souls .
Life as a true Christian makes peace and happiness .
Of course , we have good reasons to rejoice in Jehovah’s service .
Let us consider three of them . ​ — Habakkuk 3 : 18 .
We serve our Creator , the happy God .
Jehovah is the Creator and gives us life .
Therefore , let us continue to serve him with joy , even though many years pass when we get baptized .
Héctor continued to be happy by remembering his Kingdom hope and zealous in his service to Jehovah
Consider a brother named Héctor , who has been serving as a traveling overseer .
Even when he “ grew old ” continued to serve Jehovah with joy .
Although his wife’s health prevents him from doing anything in Jehovah’s service , Héctor continues to be happy .
He said : “ My wife was sick and gradually added to her situation , and I was very distressed , but this situation did not prevent me from serving God with joy .
Jehovah gave me life and created humans with his purpose , so I love him and serve him whole - souled .
I try to be zealous in the ministry , and I meditate on what God’s Kingdom will bring to my joy . ”
Jehovah provides the ransom , which makes us happy in life .
“ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - begotten Son , that everyone exercising faith in him may not be destroyed but have everlasting life . ”
This is a good reason for gratitude and that moves us to serve Jehovah with joy .
Jesús simplified his life , and he served Jehovah with joy for many years
But I do so because of my money .
When I began to learn about Jehovah and how he gave his son for the ransom , I was determined to serve him .
I dedicated myself to Jehovah and got baptized .
Then I retired after 28 years of employment and began serving in the full - time ministry . ”
As Jesús began to serve Jehovah with joy .
We live by good morals , and this makes us happy .
Can you recall how your life is before you start serving Jehovah ?
The apostle Paul told Christians in Rome that they were “ slaves of sin in the past ” but now “ slaves to righteousness . ”
We too live in harmony with Jehovah’s reminders , so we do not face problems that result in sexual immorality or lack of faith .
What a joy that is !
“ For the years I have been happy in my life are those I have served Jehovah . ” ​ — Jaime .
Jaime says : “ I gradually realized that a loving Father exists and is a merciful God .
Following Jehovah’s loving principles has protected me greatly .
Imagine that I had not changed my attitude , perhaps I had been killed as former friends .
For the years , I was happy in my life as those I served Jehovah . ”
How should we feel as we await the end of this wicked world ?
Therefore , “ we should not give up in doing what is good , for when it comes to reap , if we are not tired . ”
With Jehovah’s help , let us continue to endure , working hard to cultivate the qualities we need to survive “ the great tribulation , ” and keep on serving Jehovah with joy . ​ — Revelation 7 : 9 , 13 , 14 ; James 1 : 2 - 4 .
We can be sure that Jehovah will bless us if we endure , for he knows what we do .
He also knows that we love him and protect his name .
Because my heart was firmly joyful , and my body will stay awake . ” ​ — Psalm 16 : 8 , 9 .
How did Jonathan , King Saul , remain loyal to Jehovah ?
How can we remain loyal to God when we see that a powerful one is not worthy of our obedience ?
How can we maintain our integrity to Jehovah when others make misunderstandings or injustice ?
Why was Jonathan and David a fine example of integrity ?
David’s courage must have impressed Jonathan .
David killed a man named Goliath and brought this “ slave ” to Jonathan , King Saul of Israel .
Jonathan knew that God was with David , since then , Jonathan and David became close friends .
They promised that they would remain loyal to one another .
When Saul tried to kill David , Jonathan was concerned about his friend .
Jonathan knew that David was a wilderness in Horesh and went to the place to strengthen David to trust in Jehovah .
Hence , Jonathan went to the place for David : “ Do not be afraid , for the hand of Saul my father will not find you , and you will become king over Israel , and I will become your follower . ” ​ — 1 Samuel 23 : 16 , 17 .
What is more important to Jonathan , and how do we know that ?
We want faithful people .
In fact , he remained faithful to David and did not jealous of David , even though he would be king in his control .
( a ) What will bring us great joy and satisfaction ?
We must remain loyal to our family , friends , and fellow believers in the congregation .
In addition , we know that we must remain loyal to God even though doing so is difficult .
In this article , we will consider how Jonathan can help us to remain loyal to Jehovah in four aspects : ( 1 ) when we see a powerful force does not deserve to obey him , ( 2 ) when making decisions on someone who will remain loyal to him , ( 3 ) when a wicked brother is unrighteous or unrighteous .
Why was it difficult for the people of Israel to remain loyal to God when Saul was ruling ?
Jonathan and the people of Israel were in a difficult situation .
Jonathan , King Saul , disobeyed , and Jehovah rejected him .
What shows that Jonathan remained loyal to Jehovah ?
Jonathan remained loyal to Jehovah .
At that time , many Philistines came with 30,000 chariots to attack the Israelites .
But Jonathan was not afraid .
He recalls the words of the prophet Samuel : “ Jehovah will not leave his people for his great name . ”
Jonathan told a military soldier : “ Nothing will prevent Jehovah from doing . . salvation through many or through the hands of the little . ”
So he and the soldiers led to a Philistine group and killed 20 people .
Jonathan had faith and Jehovah blessed him .
Although Saul continued to disobey Jehovah , Jonathan obeyed his father whenever possible .
For example , they fight together to save Jehovah’s people . ​ — 1 Samuel 31 : 1 , 2 .
In what way are we loyal to God if we obey rulers ?
Like Jonathan , we can remain loyal to Jehovah by obeying the government in which we live .
Hence , we should obey a government officials or when he does not obey law or feel unworthy of our obedience .
He told her that he would leave her to go with the children .
Olga , however , did not die “ evil and bad . ”
She did all she could to become a good wife .
Furthermore , if she finds the right time , he is following him when he wants to visit his relatives and friends .
Some years later , Olga lost her oppression because of her patience and obedience .
How did Jonathan know who should be loyal to him ?
When Saul said that he would kill David , Jonathan needed to make a difficult decision .
He wanted to remain loyal to his father , but he wanted to remain loyal to David .
He warned David to hide and told Saul why he should not kill David . ​ — Read 1 Samuel 19 : 1 - 6 .
How does our love for God help us to resolve our integrity to him ?
Alice from Osteustralia needed to make decisions to someone who would remain loyal to him .
She also told them to stop working with Christmas , and she explained why she would do so .
They feel that Alice abandoned them .

Alice says : “ I was surprised , and I was deeply distressed because I loved our family .
Yet , I am determined to love Jehovah and his Son with all my heart , and I got baptized at the next circuit assembly . ” ​ — Matthew 10 : 37 .
We should not allow anything , such as the love of a music group , school , or country where we live in it is more important than our devotion to Jehovah .
Henry , for example , enjoys working at a telephone called chess and a class of schools and wanted to participate their schools .
Henry says that he observes that he put the priorities of school ahead of his devotion to God .
How can maintaining integrity to God help us to cope with problems in our family ?
At times , it may be difficult to remain loyal to all family members at once .
Ken , for example , says : “ I wanted to visit my elderly mother regularly and came with us at times .
However , my mother and my wife did not prepare . ”
He continues : “ If I want to please one another , I must make the other sad . ”
Ken thought about what the Bible says and realized that in this situation should please his wife and remain loyal to her .
So he made a decision that pleased his wife .
He also explained to his mother why she should respect his wife . ​ — Read Genesis 2 : 24 ; 1 Corinthians 13 : 4 , 5 .
How did Saul react to Jonathan ?
We can remain loyal to Jehovah if a brother who is taking the lead in the congregation has injustice .
He remained loyal to Jehovah and David , whom God chose to become Israel’s king . ​ — 1 Samuel 20 : 30 - 41 .
What should we do if a brother has injustice ?
The brothers who are taking the lead in the congregations today strive to treat all the right way .
So if we are injustice or not understood , let us remain loyal to Jehovah .
In what situations can we remain loyal to God and not be selfish ?
However , Jonathan loved Jehovah and remained loyal to him .
Instead of becoming self - centered , Jonathan became David’s friend and fulfilled his promise to him .
For example , if we make a business vow , we will do what we have promised , even though it is difficult .
If we make a business vow , we will do what we promise to do because we are loyal to God ( See paragraph 16 )
We should remain loyal to God even though under difficult circumstances , such as Jonathan .
So let us remain loyal to our brothers when they hurt us .
Then we will make Jehovah happy , and this is the most happiness we can be .
In the following article , we will learn a lesson from some people in David’s day , who remained faithful and those who do not .
[ 1 ] ( paragraph 9 ) Some names have been changed .
In difficult situations , we think about what Jehovah wants us to do and obey him because we love him more than anyone or anything else
“ The rulers ” : Government and their workers whom Jehovah has given them authority over us .
He wants us to respect them and obey them if what they want to do in harmony with Jehovah’s direction
“ What does Jehovah search for you , but the work of truth and the love of mercy and walk with your God ? ” ​ — MICAH 6 : 8 .
Why did Jonathan treat David differ from the way Abner tre@@
What qualities can help us to remain loyal to God , and how can we do so ?
How did David demonstrate his loyalty to God ?
But David did not leave him to kill Saul .
He told Abishai : “ Let him not be destroyed , for who is able to present his hand on the anointed of Jehovah and become innocent ? ”
David understood what remaining faithful or obeying Jehovah meant .
He knew that he needed to respect Saul and should not think of him .
Today , Jehovah expects his servants to remain loyal to him and to respect authority . ​ — Read Micah 6 : 8 .
Abishai appreciated David because he knew that David was God’s choice to be King .
Yet , after David became king , he committed serious sins .
( a ) How did David set an example of loyalty to God ?
( b ) What examples will we consider ?
David remained faithful throughout his life .
David immediately accepted his sin and repented .
Later , when David was old , he gave many valuable things to use them to build Jehovah’s temple .
In addition , we will consider some qualities that will help us to remain faithful .
What lesson do we learn from Abishai ?
When Abishai wanted to kill Saul , he wanted to show his obedience to David .
However , David knew that “ the anointed of Jehovah ” was sinful , so he did not allow Abishai to kill Saul .
The important lesson we can learn here is : When we need to decide whether to obey him , we should consider Bible principles that can help us in the situation .
How important it is to remain loyal to Jehovah than anyone else
Though we want to show loyalty to our household and friends , why should we guard ?
We want to show loyalty to those whom we love , such as our friends or family members .
How did one sister remain loyal to God in a difficult situation ?
For example , Anne was disfellowshipped , and she called Anne that she wanted to visit her .
Anne said that she was lost because everyone in the family refused to speak to her .
Before writing the letter , Anne meditated on some Bible principles .
What qualities can help us to remain loyal to God ?
Why did Abner try to kill David ?
Later , he helped Saul when he wanted to kill David .
Jonathan and Abner knew that David had chosen David to be king of Israel after Saul .
Later , Abner may have tried to make himself king , perhaps so he spent one of Saul’s wives .
Why did Jonathan and Abner have a different view of David ?
Why did Absalom not remain loyal to God ?
King Absalom was not loyal to God because he was not humble .
Moreover , he influenced many Israelites to support him .
He even tried to kill his father even though he knew Jehovah that David was the king of Israel . ​ — 2 Samuel 15 : 13 , 14 ; 17 : 1 - 4 .
How can we benefit from the account of Abner , Absalom , and Baruch , in the Bible ?
Jehovah then told Baruch : “ Look ! What I have built , I will deceive ; and what I have planted , I will throw away , and this is everywhere in this land .
Are you seeking great things to yourself ?
Do not seek them . ”
Baruch listened to Jehovah .
Explain why we cannot remain loyal to God if we are sincere .
But he realized that he did what he wanted to do for the heart .
He did not obey God , and he needed to be humble .
After praying with tears , I stopped writing her a letter .
Shortly thereafter , I was happy in my ministry . ”

How did Nathan remain loyal to Jehovah and David when David sinned ?
After David abandoned a man and killed him , Jehovah sent Nathan to warn David .
Nathan was courageous and followed Jehovah’s command .
He wanted to help David know that David had committed serious sins .
Hence , he told him about a man who had taken a brief lamb of a poor man .
Nathan said : “ You are the man . ”
How can you remain loyal to Jehovah , your friend , or relatives ?
For example , you may be reasonable that your brother has committed serious sin .
Ask him that he went to tell the elders what he did without delay .
If he does not come , go to tell the elders for yourself .
Also , you are helping your brother , for elders can help him to strengthen his relationship with Jehovah .
They will gradually correct him and be reasonable . ​ — Read Leviticus 5 : 1 ; Galatians 6 : 1 .
Why did Hushai need courage to remain loyal to Jehovah ?
Hushai was a loyal friend of King David .
When people wanted to appoint Absalom king , Hushai wanted to remain loyal to David and God , but he needed courage to do so .
He knew that Absalom went to Jerusalem and his army and David fled .
But what did Hushai do ?
Did he turn his back to David to support Absalom ?
Though David was old and many wanted to kill him , Hushai remained loyal to David because Jehovah appointed David .
So Hushai went to David at the Mount of weeds . ​ — 2 Samuel 15 : 30 , 32 .
Why do we need courage to remain faithful ?
We need to be courageous and obedient to Jehovah instead of doing what our family , fellow workmates , or authorities want us to
For example , Taro , a brother in Japan , was pleased to his parents since his childhood .
But when Jehovah’s Witnesses began to study the Bible with him , his parents tried to stop him .
I prayed for courage and stick to my decision .
Now they changed their thinking and visit them regularly . ” ​ — Read Proverbs 29 : 25 .
How have you benefited from this article ?
We should not be like Abner and Absalom .
[ 1 ] ( paragraph 7 ) Some names have been changed .
If we are faithful and humble , we will focus on what Jehovah wants us to do , not what we want to do .
If we are faithful and kind , we will be able to help others , and we will treat them as Jehovah wants us to be
If we are faithful and courageous , we will obey Jehovah even though doing so is difficult or courageous
