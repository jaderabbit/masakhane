Author: Michael Beukman

## Data

	- The JW300 English-Tshivenda dataset.

## Model

- Default Masakhane Transformer translation model, [into-english notebook](https://github.com/masakhane-io/masakhane-mt/blob/master/starter_notebook_into_English_training.ipynb), with some changes, specifically changing the model parameters to be larger, as specified in the TODOs. We trained for 30 epochs.

The notebook contains the results of training the smaller model too, but the larger one showed superior results.

## Analysis
At the end of the training, the results were:


Example 1
```
Source:     Vhukuma , luvalo lwa ‘ muthu wa nga ngomu ’ lu nga kha ḓi ri xedza .
Reference:  Yes , the voice of “ the man we are inside ” may fail us .

Reference:  To remain blameless in today ’ s complex and wicked world , we must train our “ powers of discernment ” so that we can distinguish not just right from wrong but also wise from unwise. — Heb . 5 : 14 ; Eph . 5 : 15 .
Hypothesis: That will enable us to know the difference between right and wrong and to know the difference between foolishness and wisdom and discreet peated. — Heb . 5 : 14 ; Eph . 5 : 15 .
