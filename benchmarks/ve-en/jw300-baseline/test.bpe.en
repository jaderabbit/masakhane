This magaz@@ ine has been publi@@ shed continu@@ ously since 1@@ 8@@ 7@@ 9 and is n@@ on@@ politi@@ cal .
It ad@@ her@@ es to the Bible as its authority .
It is provided as part of a worl@@ d@@ wide Bible e@@ duc@@ ational work sup@@ por@@ ted by vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary d@@ on@@ ations .
To make a d@@ on@@ ation , please vis@@ it w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ j@@ w@@ .@@ or@@ g .
Un@@ less o@@ ther@@ wise indic@@ ated , S@@ crip@@ ture qu@@ ot@@ ations are from the mo@@ der@@ n - language New World Tr@@ ans@@ l@@ ation of the H@@ o@@ ly Scriptures .
Be@@ be had been very close to her father .
The re@@ mar@@ k came from a well - meaning family friend , but Be@@ be found it more c@@ u@@ tting than com@@ for@@ ting .
“ His death wa@@ s@@ n@@ ’@@ t for the best , ” she kept re@@ pe@@ ating to her@@ self .
It was clear that when Be@@ be rec@@ oun@@ ted the in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent in a book years later , she was still gri@@ ev@@ ing .
As Be@@ be came to see , it can take a long time for someone to over@@ come gri@@ ef , especially when the b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved person was very close to the dec@@ eas@@ ed .
In the Bible , death is ap@@ tly describ@@ ed as “ the last ene@@ my . ”
It bre@@ ak@@ s into our lives with ir@@ res@@ is@@ ti@@ ble for@@ ce , often when we are comp@@ let@@ ely un@@ prepar@@ ed , and it ro@@ bs us of those we hold de@@ ar .
N@@ one of us are im@@ mu@@ ne to its ra@@ v@@ ages .
So it is not sur@@ pris@@ ing if we feel at a lo@@ ss when it comes to cop@@ ing with death and its af@@ ter@@ mat@@ h .
Per@@ haps you have wonder@@ ed : ‘ How long does it take to get over gri@@ ef ?
How can I comfort others who have been b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved ?
Is there any hope for our loved ones who have died ? ’
Ha@@ ve you ever had a b@@ ri@@ ef b@@ out with ill@@ ness ?
As an example , consider how the p@@ at@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch Abraham re@@ ac@@ ted when his wife died .
The Bible says that “ Abraham began to m@@ our@@ n and to w@@ eep over S@@ ar@@ ah . ”
The expres@@ sion “ began to ” su@@ gg@@ ests that it took some time for him to cop@@ e with his lo@@ ss .
He gri@@ ev@@ ed for “ many days , ” and his family members were u@@ na@@ ble to comfort him .
S@@ ever@@ al years later , the death of Joseph still w@@ ei@@ gh@@ ed heav@@ ily on his mind . ​ — Genesis 23 : 2 ; 37 : 34 , 35 ; 42 : 36 ; 45 : 28 .
“ My husband , R@@ ob@@ ert , died on J@@ uly 9 , 200@@ 8 .
S@@ i@@ x years later the pain in my heart is still there .
I d@@ on@@ ’@@ t think I will ever get over my lo@@ ss of R@@ o@@ b . ” ​ — G@@ a@@ il , ag@@ ed 60 .
“ Although I have been without my de@@ ar wife for more than 18 years , I still mis@@ s her and gri@@ eve over my lo@@ ss .
Wh@@ ene@@ ver I see something in n@@ ature that is att@@ rac@@ tive , my thoughts go to her , and I cannot help wonder@@ ing how she would have enjo@@ yed see@@ ing what I am see@@ ing . ” ​ — E@@ ti@@ en@@ ne , ag@@ ed 8@@ 4 .
C@@ learly , such pa@@ in@@ ful and long - lasting feelings are only n@@ atu@@ ral .
E@@ ach person gri@@ ev@@ es in his or her own way , and it would be un@@ wise to jud@@ ge the way another person respon@@ ds to tra@@ ge@@ dy .
At the same time , we may need to hold off from con@@ dem@@ ning ourselves if our re@@ action to lo@@ ss seem@@ s exc@@ es@@ sive .
As we note in the “ I@@ m@@ itate Their Fa@@ ith ” article in this is@@ sue , Isa@@ a@@ c was still gri@@ ev@@ ing over the lo@@ ss of his mother , S@@ ar@@ ah , three years after her death . ​ — Genesis 24 : 6@@ 7 .
For instance , you may find that some will adv@@ ise you not to c@@ ry or show your feelings in any way .
O@@ thers may p@@ us@@ h you to do the op@@ pos@@ ite and exp@@ ose all your feelings .
The Bible pres@@ ents a more b@@ al@@ anc@@ ed view , one that is sup@@ por@@ ted by mo@@ der@@ n res@@ ear@@ ch .
In some cul@@ tu@@ res it is consider@@ ed un@@ man@@ ly for a m@@ ale to c@@ ry .
But is there a real need to feel a@@ sh@@ am@@ ed about sh@@ ed@@ ding te@@ ars , even in publi@@ c ?
M@@ ental - health ex@@ per@@ ts ac@@ knowledge that te@@ ar@@ ful@@ ness is a nor@@ ma@@ l part of gri@@ ev@@ ing .
And gri@@ ev@@ ing may , in time , help you to move on des@@ p@@ ite the en@@ or@@ m@@ ity of your lo@@ ss .
S@@ up@@ pres@@ sing gri@@ ef , however , may do more har@@ m than good .
The Bible l@@ end@@ s no support to the no@@ tion that it is wrong or un@@ man@@ ly to shed te@@ ars of gri@@ ef .
At the death of his de@@ ar friend La@@ z@@ ar@@ us , Jesus op@@ en@@ ly w@@ ept , even though he had the power to bring the dead back to life ! ​ — John 11 : 33 - 35 .
B@@ ou@@ ts of anger are often part of gri@@ ev@@ ing , especially in c@@ as@@ es of su@@ d@@ den , un@@ exp@@ ected death .
There are many reas@@ ons why a b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved person may feel ang@@ ry , such as when thou@@ gh@@ t@@ less and un@@ f@@ ound@@ ed comm@@ ents are made by a resp@@ ected person .
“ I was only 14 years old when my father died , ” expla@@ ins a S@@ ou@@ th A@@ fri@@ can man na@@ med Mi@@ ke .
“ At the fun@@ er@@ al , the A@@ ng@@ li@@ can minis@@ ter said that God needs good people and takes them early .
* This ang@@ ered me because we des@@ per@@ ately needed our father .
E@@ speci@@ ally in the case of un@@ exp@@ ected death , the b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved person may re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly think , ‘ It might not have happened if only I had done this or that . ’
If you are being pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed by such feelings of gu@@ il@@ t and anger , it is important not to bo@@ t@@ tle up these emo@@ tions .
Rather , speak to a friend who will listen and reas@@ sure you that such ir@@ r@@ ational feelings are comm@@ on to many b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved ones .
The Bible remind@@ s us : “ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of dis@@ tr@@ ess . ” ​ — Proverbs 17 : 17 .
The best F@@ ri@@ end a b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved person can have is our Creator , Jehovah God .
P@@ our out your heart to him in prayer because “ he car@@ es for you . ”
Mo@@ re@@ over , he promises that all who do so will have their thoughts and feelings so@@ o@@ th@@ ed by “ the peace of God that sur@@ pas@@ ses all understanding . ”
Al@@ so , allow God to help you he@@ al by means of his cons@@ ol@@ ing Word , the Bible .
Ha@@ ving such thoughts to p@@ on@@ der over may be especially help@@ ful at night when you are al@@ one and find it hard to s@@ le@@ e@@ p . ​ — Isaiah 5@@ 7 : 15 .
R@@ ec@@ ently , a 40 - year - old man , whom we will c@@ all J@@ ack , lost his bel@@ o@@ ved wife to c@@ anc@@ er .
“ When I pray to Jehovah , ” he expla@@ ins , “ I never feel al@@ one .
I often wake up during the night and cannot get back to s@@ le@@ e@@ p .
After reading and med@@ it@@ ating on com@@ for@@ ting thoughts from the Scriptures and then p@@ our@@ ing out the feelings of my heart in prayer , I sense a cal@@ m@@ ness and a trans@@ c@@ end@@ ing peace come over me , pu@@ tting my mind and heart at res@@ t and en@@ ab@@ ling me to s@@ le@@ e@@ p . ”
A young woman na@@ med V@@ an@@ es@@ sa lost her mother to ill@@ ness .
She too has experienced the power of prayer .
“ In my most difficult times , ” she says , “ I would just c@@ all on God@@ ’@@ s name and bre@@ ak down in te@@ ars .
Jehovah list@@ ened to my prayers and always gave me the strength I needed . ”
Some b@@ ere@@ av@@ ement coun@@ sel@@ ors adv@@ ise those who are stru@@ gg@@ ling with gri@@ ef to get involved in help@@ ing others or to vol@@ un@@ te@@ er their time in some commun@@ ity service .
Do@@ ing so can bring joy and may e@@ ase a person@@ ’@@ s gri@@ ef .
Many b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved Christians have found that working to help others has brought them great comfort . ​ — 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 .
God feel@@ s for you in your pain . ​ — Psalm 55 : 22 ; 1 Peter 5 : 7 .
God pati@@ ently list@@ ens to the prayers of his servants . ​ — Psalm 8@@ 6 : 5 ; 1 Th@@ ess@@ aloni@@ ans 5 : 17 .
God mis@@ ses people who have died . ​ — Job 14 : 13 - 15 .
God promises to resurrec@@ t the dead . ​ — Isaiah 26 : 19 ; John 5 : 28 , 29 .
Ha@@ ve you ever felt hel@@ pl@@ ess when someone near to you was gri@@ ev@@ ing over the lo@@ ss of a loved one ?
S@@ ome@@ times we may feel un@@ sure of what to say or do ​ — so we w@@ ind up saying and doing nothing .
But there are practic@@ al , help@@ ful things that we can do .
O@@ f@@ ten , all that is needed is your pres@@ ence along with a sim@@ ple expres@@ sion , such as “ I am so sor@@ ry . ”
In many cul@@ tu@@ res , giving the person a hu@@ g or a g@@ ent@@ le s@@ qu@@ ee@@ ze of the ar@@ m is an eff@@ ective way to show you care .
If the b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved one wants to talk , listen sy@@ m@@ pa@@ the@@ tic@@ ally .
B@@ est of all , do something for the b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved family , perhaps per@@ form@@ ing a cho@@ re the gri@@ ev@@ ing one has not been able to care for , such as co@@ o@@ king a me@@ al , car@@ ing for the children , or help@@ ing with fun@@ er@@ al arrang@@ ements if that is des@@ ir@@ ed .
Such actions may speak l@@ ou@@ der than the most el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent words .
In time , you may be moved to talk about the dec@@ eas@@ ed , perhaps foc@@ using on some good qualities or happy experi@@ ences .
Such con@@ vers@@ ation may even bring a s@@ mil@@ e to the b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved person@@ ’@@ s face .
For example , Pa@@ m ​ — who lost her husband , I@@ an , si@@ x years ag@@ o — ​ says : “ People some@@ times tell me good things that I@@ an did that I never knew about , and that makes my heart feel good . ”
R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers re@@ port that many b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved people receive a lo@@ t of in@@ iti@@ al help but that their needs are soon for@@ go@@ t@@ ten as friends get bus@@ y again with their own lives .
There@@ fore , make a point of cont@@ ac@@ ting a b@@ ere@@ a@@ ved friend on a reg@@ ular bas@@ is after the lo@@ ss .
* Many gri@@ ev@@ ing ones dee@@ ply appreci@@ ate this opportunity to reli@@ eve themselves of pro@@ long@@ ed feelings of gri@@ ef .
Consider the example of K@@ a@@ o@@ ri , a young J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese woman who was dev@@ ast@@ ated by the lo@@ ss of her mother follow@@ ed by the lo@@ ss of her older sister 15 mon@@ ths later .
T@@ han@@ k@@ fully , she received on@@ going support from loyal friends .
One na@@ med R@@ it@@ su@@ ko is much older than K@@ a@@ o@@ ri and off@@ ered to be her close friend .
“ To be hon@@ est , ” says K@@ a@@ o@@ ri , “ I wa@@ s@@ n@@ ’@@ t happy about that .
I di@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t want anyone to take the place of my mother , and I di@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t think that anyone could .
However , because of the way M@@ ama R@@ it@@ su@@ ko tre@@ ated me , I came to feel close to her .
E@@ very wee@@ k , we went out in the ev@@ ang@@ eli@@ zing work together and went to Christian meetings together .
She inv@@ ited me to have tea with her , brought me me@@ als , and wrote me let@@ ters and car@@ ds many times .
M@@ ama R@@ it@@ su@@ ko@@ ’@@ s pos@@ itive attitude had a good influ@@ ence on me . ”
T@@ wel@@ ve years have pas@@ sed since K@@ a@@ ori@@ ’@@ s mother died , and today she and her husband are full - time ev@@ ang@@ eli@@ z@@ ers .
“ M@@ ama R@@ it@@ su@@ ko , ” K@@ a@@ o@@ ri says , “ continu@@ es to show her concer@@ n .
When I go back home , I always vis@@ it her and enjoy her up@@ building associ@@ ation . ”
A@@ no@@ ther example of someone who benef@@ ited from on@@ going support is P@@ ol@@ i , one of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses in C@@ y@@ pr@@ us .
P@@ ol@@ i had a kind husband , So@@ z@@ o@@ s , who set a good example as a Christian shepher@@ d by often inv@@ iting or@@ p@@ han@@ s and wi@@ do@@ ws to their home for associ@@ ation and a me@@ al .
S@@ ad@@ ly , at the age of 5@@ 3 , So@@ z@@ o@@ s died of a b@@ ra@@ in t@@ um@@ or .
There , they began associ@@ ating with a congregation of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
“ The friends in my new congregation , ” rec@@ al@@ ls P@@ ol@@ i , “ did not know anything about our past and our difficult circumstances .
But that did not sto@@ p them from appro@@ aching us and emb@@ rac@@ ing us with their kind words and practic@@ al help .
How preci@@ ous that help was , especially at that time , when my son needed his father most !
Those taking the lead in the congregation showed a great deal of personal interest in Daniel .
One in par@@ tic@@ ular made sure to inclu@@ de Daniel when enjo@@ ying associ@@ ation with friends or when going out to pla@@ y b@@ all . ”
Bo@@ th mother and son are doing well today .
To be sure , there are many ways we can offer practic@@ al help and comfort to those who m@@ our@@ n .
The Bible also com@@ forts us by means of a thr@@ ill@@ ing hope for the future .
Some have even mar@@ ked the d@@ ate of the death on their cal@@ end@@ ar as a remind@@ er to offer comfort when it may be most needed ​ — on or near the d@@ ate of the lo@@ ss .
You may rec@@ all that G@@ a@@ il , mentioned ear@@ li@@ er in this seri@@ es , doub@@ ts whether she will ever get over the death of her husband , R@@ o@@ b .
However , she is loo@@ king for@@ ward to see@@ ing him again in God@@ ’@@ s promised new world .
My feelings really go out to people who have lost someone they love but who are not aw@@ are of this hope of see@@ ing their loved one again . ”
So@@ on , God will do just that ​ — for Job and coun@@ t@@ less others — ​ when this earth is trans@@ form@@ ed into a parad@@ ise .
“ There is going to be a resurrection , ” the Bible con@@ fir@@ ms at Acts 24 : 15 .
“ Do not be a@@ ma@@ zed at this , ” Jesus as@@ sures us , “ for the ho@@ ur is coming in which all those in the m@@ emori@@ al to@@ mb@@ s will hear his vo@@ ice and come out . ”
He will have the prosp@@ ect of re@@ ga@@ ining “ his you@@ th@@ ful vi@@ g@@ or , ” and his flesh will forever remain “ f@@ re@@ sh@@ er than in you@@ th . ”
The same will happ@@ en to all who respond with appreciation to God@@ ’@@ s mer@@ ci@@ ful pro@@ vision of a resurrection to life on earth .
If you have suffer@@ ed the lo@@ ss of someone de@@ ar to you , the information we have discus@@ sed may not comp@@ let@@ ely take away your gri@@ ef .
But by med@@ it@@ ating on God@@ ’@@ s promises found in the Bible , you can find real hope and the strength to keep going . ​ — 1 Th@@ ess@@ aloni@@ ans 4 : 13 .
W@@ ould you like to learn more about how to cop@@ e with gri@@ ef ?
O@@ r do you have rel@@ ated questions , such as “ Why does God allow evil and suffering ? ”
P@@ le@@ ase vis@@ it our we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , j@@ w@@ .@@ or@@ g , to see how the Bible gives com@@ for@@ ting , practic@@ al answ@@ ers .
W@@ HA@@ T EL@@ S@@ E C@@ A@@ N W@@ E L@@ E@@ AR@@ N F@@ R@@ O@@ M THE B@@ I@@ B@@ L@@ E ?
“ God . . . will wi@@ pe out every te@@ ar from their eyes , and death will be no more . ” ​ — Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 .
This is@@ sue of The Watchtower discus@@ ses how God will ful@@ f@@ ill that promise and what it can mean for you .
C@@ O@@ V@@ ER S@@ U@@ B@@ J@@ E@@ C@@ T | W@@ H@@ Y D@@ I@@ D J@@ ES@@ U@@ S S@@ U@@ F@@ F@@ ER AN@@ D D@@ I@@ E ?
In the sp@@ ring of 33 C.@@ E . , Jesus the Na@@ z@@ ar@@ ene was ex@@ ecu@@ ted .
He had been fal@@ sel@@ y c@@ har@@ ged with se@@ d@@ ition , sa@@ v@@ ag@@ ely be@@ at@@ en , and na@@ iled to a st@@ ake .
But God ra@@ ised him back to life , and 40 days later , Jesus as@@ c@@ ended to heaven .
This ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ary account comes to us from the four G@@ os@@ p@@ els of the Christian Greek Scriptures , comm@@ only called the New T@@ est@@ am@@ ent .
On the other hand , if those events really did happ@@ en , then there is a b@@ right future for mankind , one in which you can share .
So , are the G@@ os@@ pe@@ l acc@@ oun@@ ts fact or fic@@ tion ?
Un@@ like fan@@ ci@@ ful le@@ g@@ end@@ s , the G@@ os@@ pe@@ l writ@@ ings refl@@ ect pa@@ inst@@ aking acc@@ u@@ rac@@ y and attention to de@@ ta@@ il .
For example , they ab@@ ound with na@@ m@@ es of real plac@@ es , many of which can be vis@@ ited today .
They tell about real people , who@@ se ex@@ ist@@ ence has been cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ated by sec@@ ular hist@@ ori@@ ans . ​ — Luke 3 : 1 , 2 , 23 .
Jesus himself is mentioned by sec@@ ular writ@@ ers of the first and second cent@@ uri@@ es .
* His man@@ ner of death , as describ@@ ed in the G@@ os@@ p@@ els , ag@@ re@@ es with R@@ oman ex@@ ecu@@ ti@@ onal me@@ tho@@ ds of the time .
Mo@@ re@@ over , events are rel@@ ated in a fac@@ tu@@ al and can@@ did man@@ ner ​ — even por@@ tra@@ ying some of Jesus ’ disciples un@@ fav@@ or@@ ably .
All these fac@@ t@@ ors str@@ ong@@ ly indic@@ ate that the G@@ os@@ pe@@ l writ@@ ers were hon@@ est and acc@@ ur@@ ate in what they wrote about Jesus .
While it is gener@@ ally accep@@ ted that Jesus lived and died , some would question his resurrection .
Even his apostles did not believe the in@@ iti@@ al re@@ port of his having re@@ turned to life .
All doubt was re@@ moved , however , when they and other disciples saw the resurrec@@ ted Jesus on se@@ par@@ ate occ@@ asi@@ ons .
In fact , in one case , there were more than 5@@ 00 ey@@ ew@@ itnesses present . ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 6 .
At the ris@@ k of being ar@@ res@@ ted and kill@@ ed , the disciples coura@@ ge@@ ously pro@@ claim@@ ed Jesus ’ resurrection to all ​ — even to the very ones who had ex@@ ecu@@ ted him .
W@@ ould so many disciples have been so b@@ old if they were not ab@@ sol@@ u@@ t@@ ely sure that Jesus had really been resurrec@@ ted ?
In fact , the re@@ ality of the resurrection of Jesus is the d@@ ri@@ ving for@@ ce be@@ h@@ ind the im@@ p@@ act that Christi@@ an@@ ity has had on the world both then and now .
The G@@ os@@ pe@@ l acc@@ oun@@ ts of Jesus ’ death and resurrection be@@ ar all the necess@@ ary mar@@ ks of an au@@ th@@ enti@@ c hist@@ or@@ ic@@ al rec@@ ord .
C@@ ar@@ e@@ fully reading them will con@@ v@@ in@@ ce you that these events really happened .
Your con@@ vi@@ ction can be fur@@ ther strength@@ ened when you understand why they took place .
T@@ ac@@ it@@ us , born about 55 C.@@ E . , wrote that “ Chris@@ t@@ us , from whom the name [ Christians ] had its ori@@ g@@ in , suffer@@ ed the ex@@ tre@@ me p@@ en@@ al@@ ty during the re@@ ign of T@@ i@@ b@@ eri@@ us at the h@@ ands of one of our pro@@ c@@ ur@@ at@@ ors , P@@ on@@ ti@@ us P@@ il@@ at@@ us . ”
Jesus is also refer@@ red to by Su@@ e@@ t@@ oni@@ us ( first century ) ; J@@ ew@@ ish hist@@ ori@@ an Josep@@ hus ( first century ) ; and P@@ l@@ in@@ y the Y@@ ou@@ ng@@ er , gover@@ nor of Bi@@ th@@ y@@ n@@ ia ( early second century ) .
Then , too , it is un@@ likely that Jesus ’ many op@@ pos@@ ers would wr@@ ite anything that would l@@ end cre@@ di@@ b@@ ility to the re@@ por@@ ts about him .
Re@@ gar@@ ding Jesus ’ resurrection , Peter , one of his apostles , explained : “ God ra@@ ised this one up on the th@@ ir@@ d day and allow@@ ed him to become man@@ i@@ f@@ est , not to all the people , but to w@@ itnesses appointed be@@ fore@@ hand by God , to us , who ate and d@@ ran@@ k with him after his ris@@ ing from the dead . ”
Matthe@@ w@@ ’@@ s G@@ os@@ pe@@ l tel@@ ls us that when the religious ene@@ mies heard re@@ por@@ ts of Jesus ’ resurrection , they sc@@ he@@ med to sup@@ pres@@ s them . ​ — Matthew 28 : 11 - 15 .
Does this mean that Jesus wanted his resurrection to be kept sec@@ re@@ t ?
No , for Peter went on to say : “ He or@@ der@@ ed us to preach to the people and to give a thor@@ ough witness that this is the one dec@@ re@@ ed by God to be jud@@ ge of the living and the dead . ”
Tru@@ e Christians have done and are doing just that . ​ — Acts 10 : 42 .
“ Th@@ r@@ ough one man [ Adam ] sin enter@@ ed into the world and death through sin . ” ​ — Romans 5 : 12
What would you say if you were asked , “ Do you want to live forever ? ”
M@@ ost people would pro@@ b@@ ably say that they want to but that they feel it is un@@ re@@ al@@ is@@ tic to consider it .
De@@ ath is a nor@@ ma@@ l part of life , they say , the n@@ atu@@ ral out@@ come of our ex@@ ist@@ ence .
Su@@ pp@@ ose , though , that the question were turned around and you were asked , “ Are you ready to di@@ e ? ”
U@@ nd@@ er nor@@ ma@@ l circumstances , most people would answer no .
The Bible shows that God cre@@ ated humans with the desire and the will to live .
In fact , it says that “ he has even put e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity in their heart . ” ​ — Ecc@@ l@@ esi@@ ast@@ es 3 : 11 .
The re@@ ality , though , is that humans do not live forever .
F@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , has God done anything to re@@ me@@ dy the situation ?
The Bi@@ ble@@ ’@@ s answ@@ ers are hear@@ t@@ ening , and they have a direc@@ t be@@ aring on why Jesus suffer@@ ed and died .
The first three chap@@ ters of the Bible book of Genesis tell us that God set before the first human couple , Adam and Eve , the prosp@@ ect of un@@ end@@ ing life and told them what they would have to do to gain it .
Then the account describ@@ es how they fa@@ iled to obey God and lost that prosp@@ ect .
The st@@ ory is told simply ​ — so simply that some are quic@@ k to dis@@ mis@@ s it as fol@@ k@@ l@@ ore .
But Genesis , like the G@@ os@@ p@@ els , gives every indic@@ ation of being a fac@@ tu@@ al , hist@@ or@@ ic@@ al rec@@ ord .
What has been the result of Adam@@ ’@@ s fa@@ il@@ ure to obey ?
The Bible answ@@ ers this way : “ Th@@ r@@ ough one man [ Adam ] sin enter@@ ed into the world and death through sin , and so death sp@@ read to all men because they had all sin@@ ned . ”
He thus lost the prosp@@ ect of end@@ less life and ev@@ ent@@ ually died .
Be@@ ing his des@@ c@@ end@@ ants , we have inher@@ ited his sin@@ ful cond@@ ition .
But has God done anything to re@@ me@@ dy the situation ?
Yes , God made arrang@@ ements to re@@ dee@@ m , or bu@@ y back , what Adam had lost for his des@@ c@@ end@@ ants , na@@ m@@ ely , the prosp@@ ect of end@@ less life .
“ The wa@@ ges sin pa@@ ys is death , ” says the Bible at Romans 6 : 23 .
This means that death is the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of sin .
Li@@ k@@ ew@@ ise , we sin and are therefore sub@@ ject to sin@@ ’@@ s wa@@ ges , death .
But we were born in this sin@@ ful cond@@ ition through no fa@@ ult of our own .
So God lov@@ ingly sent his Son , Jesus , to accept ‘ the wa@@ ges of sin ’ for us .
Jesus ’ death op@@ ens the way to a happy , end@@ less life
Since one man , the perfect man Adam , brought sin and death on us through dis@@ obedi@@ ence , a perfect man obedi@@ ent even t@@ ill death was needed to r@@ ele@@ ase us from that bur@@ den .
The Bible expla@@ ins it this way : “ Just as through the dis@@ obedi@@ ence of the one man many were made sin@@ n@@ ers , so also through the obedi@@ ence of the one person many will be made righteous . ”
He left heaven , became a perfect man * , and died in our be@@ half .
As a result , it is possible for us to have a righteous standing with God and gain the prosp@@ ect of end@@ less life .
Why , though , was it necess@@ ary for Jesus to di@@ e to ac@@ com@@ pl@@ ish this ?
C@@ ould not Al@@ mi@@ gh@@ ty God have simply is@@ su@@ ed a dec@@ ree that Adam@@ ’@@ s des@@ c@@ end@@ ants be allow@@ ed to live forever ?
H@@ ad God set justice asi@@ de in this instance , people might have wonder@@ ed whether he would do so in other matters as well .
For example , would he be fa@@ ir in determin@@ ing who among Adam@@ ’@@ s off@@ sp@@ ring qu@@ ali@@ fy for e@@ ter@@ na@@ l life ?
C@@ ould he be trus@@ ted to keep his promises ?
God@@ ’@@ s ad@@ her@@ ence to justice in working out our sal@@ v@@ ation is as@@ sur@@ ance to us that he will always do what is right .
By Jesus ’ sacri@@ fici@@ al death , God op@@ ened the way to end@@ less life in Parad@@ ise on earth .
No@@ te Jesus ’ words as recorded at John 3 : 16 : “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - be@@ go@@ t@@ ten Son , so that ever@@ yone exerc@@ ising faith in him might not be destro@@ yed but have everlasting life . ”
Jesus ’ death is thus an expres@@ sion not only of God@@ ’@@ s un@@ fa@@ il@@ ing justice but , more speci@@ ally , of his great love for humans .
However , why did Jesus have to su@@ ffer and di@@ e in the pa@@ in@@ ful way that was describ@@ ed in the G@@ os@@ p@@ els ?
By sub@@ j@@ ec@@ ting himself to the ex@@ tre@@ me t@@ est and rema@@ ining faithful , Jesus re@@ fu@@ ted once and for all the D@@ ev@@ il@@ ’@@ s cla@@ im that humans would not remain loyal to God when under tri@@ al .
That cla@@ im might have seem@@ ed val@@ id after Satan ind@@ u@@ c@@ ed perfect Adam to sin .
But Jesus ​ — who was Adam@@ ’@@ s perfect e@@ qu@@ i@@ val@@ ent — ​ rema@@ ined obedi@@ ent des@@ p@@ ite s@@ ev@@ ere suffering .
He thus proved that Adam too could have obe@@ yed God if he had cho@@ s@@ en to do so .
By end@@ uring under tri@@ al , Jesus left us a mo@@ de@@ l to follow .
God re@@ war@@ ded his S@@ on@@ ’@@ s perfect obedi@@ ence , gr@@ an@@ ting Jesus immor@@ t@@ al life in heaven .
Jesus indic@@ ated what we need to do when he said : “ This means everlasting life , their coming to know you , the only true God , and the one whom you sent , Jesus Christ . ” ​ — John 17 : 3 .

“ N@@ ever ti@@ re of ex@@ per@@ im@@ ent@@ ing with new ways to appro@@ ach old sub@@ j@@ ects , ” said one father .

Let your children see how real Jehovah is to you .
“ We also tell our older daugh@@ ter , ‘ Ha@@ ve comple@@ te trust in Jehovah , keep bus@@ y in Kingdom service , and do not wor@@ ry too much . ’
When she se@@ es the out@@ come , she kno@@ ws that Jehovah is help@@ ing us .
This has done w@@ ond@@ ers for her faith in God and in the Bible . ”
The first article shows how our faith can gro@@ w and remain strong .
Let me expla@@ in what led to that con@@ vers@@ ation .
I W@@ A@@ S born in W@@ i@@ ch@@ ita , Kan@@ sa@@ s , U@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ A . , on D@@ ec@@ ember 10 , 19@@ 36 , the ol@@ des@@ t of four children .
Then a sol@@ di@@ er wal@@ ked by , and the do@@ c@@ tor y@@ el@@ led , “ Do something about this y@@ el@@ low c@@ ow@@ ard ! ”
The sol@@ di@@ er could see that the man was dr@@ un@@ k , so he told him , “ G@@ o home and s@@ ob@@ er up ! ”
He ow@@ ned two b@@ ar@@ ber@@ sh@@ op@@ s in W@@ i@@ ch@@ ita , and the do@@ c@@ tor was one of his c@@ li@@ ents !
With my parents , going to a conven@@ tion in W@@ i@@ ch@@ ita in the 19@@ 40 ’ s
With Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s blessing and their ze@@ al@@ ous work , a congregation was started .
The brother also s@@ old my c@@ ar for $ 25 .
We were assign@@ ed to special pioneer in W@@ al@@ n@@ ut R@@ id@@ ge , Ar@@ kan@@ sa@@ s .
Then in 19@@ 6@@ 2 , we were thr@@ ill@@ ed to receive an inv@@ itation to the 3@@ 7@@ th clas@@ s of Gilead .
In the ministry in Na@@ i@@ ro@@ b@@ i with Mary and Ch@@ r@@ is Kan@@ ai@@ ya
So@@ on after , our first daugh@@ ter , K@@ i@@ mb@@ er@@ ly , was born , and 17 mon@@ ths later , we had S@@ te@@ p@@ han@@ y .
We would also go cam@@ p@@ ing with them and would have very enjo@@ y@@ able con@@ vers@@ ations around the cam@@ pf@@ ire .
We arrang@@ ed to have some who were in the full - time ministry stay in our home .
They were sh@@ o@@ cked and started to c@@ ry and said that they wanted to study .
With the help and direction of God@@ ’@@ s organization , we did our best to ra@@ ise them to love Jehovah .
On a later tri@@ p , K@@ i@@ mb@@ er@@ ly me@@ t one of his work@@ mat@@ es , B@@ ri@@ an L@@ le@@ wel@@ ly@@ n .
So they did stay free until they were at le@@ ast 23 .
At the same time , B@@ ri@@ an and K@@ i@@ mb@@ er@@ ly were inv@@ ited to work at L@@ ond@@ on Bethel and later were trans@@ f@@ er@@ red to Mal@@ a@@ wi Bethel .
The day after we left for the Watchtower E@@ duc@@ ational C@@ enter in P@@ at@@ ter@@ son , L@@ ind@@ a called to tell us that M@@ other had died .
N@@ ext , we taught the course in Z@@ i@@ mb@@ ab@@ we and then in Z@@ amb@@ ia .
In 200@@ 6 , B@@ ri@@ an and K@@ i@@ mb@@ er@@ ly moved next do@@ or to us to ra@@ ise their two daugh@@ ters , M@@ ac@@ k@@ enz@@ i@@ e and Eli@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th .
Paul and S@@ te@@ p@@ han@@ y are still in Mal@@ a@@ wi , where Paul ser@@ ves on the B@@ ran@@ ch Com@@ mit@@ te@@ e .
Why might we need to ad@@ just our view of str@@ ang@@ ers ?
When I left the a@@ ir@@ port and felt the c@@ old for the first time in my life , I started cr@@ ying . ”

( b ) How can we reach our go@@ al ?
We must recogni@@ ze that when we pre@@ p@@ are for the ministry , for the meetings , or for a talk , we may not necess@@ ar@@ ily apply what we read to ourselves .
Since my mind is main@@ ly involved in an in@@ tel@@ l@@ ec@@ tu@@ al exerc@@ ise , my heart is not necess@@ ar@@ ily t@@ ou@@ ch@@ ed by the spiritual thoughts I am reading .
That is why I reg@@ ularly set asi@@ de time to study the Bible and other public@@ ations in my mother t@@ ong@@ ue . ”
“ It an@@ no@@ yed him to go out in the ministry in another language , wh@@ ere@@ as before he loved preaching in his n@@ ative language , F@@ r@@ en@@ ch , ” says Mu@@ ri@@ el .
“ When we reali@@ zed that this situation had h@@ ind@@ ered our son from making spiritual adv@@ anc@@ ement , ” expla@@ ins Ser@@ ge , “ we dec@@ ided to move back to our form@@ er congregation . ”

O@@ thers , like Eli@@ j@@ ah , “ w@@ and@@ ered about in des@@ er@@ ts and m@@ oun@@ tain@@ s and ca@@ ves and d@@ ens of the earth . ”
How does No@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s example help us to understand what it means to have faith ?
In what ways must we exerc@@ ise our faith ?
In what two ways does Hebrews 11 : 1 des@@ cri@@ be faith ?
You see that his faith was ac@@ tive along with his works and his faith was perf@@ ected by his works . ”
For example , John explained : “ The one who exerc@@ ises faith in the Son has everlasting life ; the one who dis@@ obe@@ ys the Son will not see life , but the wr@@ ath of God rema@@ ins upon him . ”
Com@@ par@@ ed with love , how important is faith ?
James asked his anointed brothers : “ Did not God cho@@ ose those who are po@@ or from the worl@@ d@@ ’@@ s stand@@ point to be ri@@ ch in faith and he@@ ir@@ s of the Kingdom , which he promised to those who love him ? ”
While men were s@@ le@@ ep@@ ing , his ene@@ my came and over@@ s@@ ow@@ ed wee@@ ds in among the whe@@ at and left .

What hope did Jehovah give his people , and why was this promise re@@ mar@@ k@@ able ?
W@@ ould the Israelites ever again be able to worship God in a comp@@ let@@ ely accep@@ table way ?
So it does not really see@@ m that Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s people enter@@ ed into cap@@ tiv@@ ity to Babyl@@ on the Gre@@ at in 19@@ 18 .

There are many reas@@ ons why we should be than@@ k@@ ful to Jehovah !
It also shows how the hope of a re@@ ward benef@@ its us .
I was only ei@@ ght years old at the time .
My father did not want my mother to talk to me about what she was lear@@ ning .
However , I was c@@ uri@@ ous and asked questions , so she stu@@ died with me when my father was out of the house .
As a result , I too dec@@ ided that I wanted to dedic@@ ate my life to Jehovah .
My mother said that I should first speak to the serv@@ ant to the bre@@ th@@ re@@ n ( now called a circ@@ u@@ it overse@@ er ) .
He said , “ G@@ o for it ! ”
After four mon@@ ths , I sel@@ ected a brother as my pioneer par@@ t@@ ner .

How , though , does the hope of a re@@ ward benefit us ?
Jesus showed that his disciples would be re@@ war@@ ded for their sacrific@@ es ( See par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph 5 )
The apostle Peter once asked Jesus : “ We have left all things and follow@@ ed you ; what , then , will there be for us ? ”
In the Ser@@ m@@ on on the M@@ ount , Jesus said : “ Re@@ jo@@ ice and be over@@ jo@@ yed , since your re@@ ward is great in the heavens , for in that way they persecu@@ ted the prophe@@ ts pri@@ or to you . ”
Moses told the nation of Israel : “ Jehovah will su@@ rely bl@@ ess you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to pos@@ s@@ ess as an inher@@ it@@ ance , but only if you stri@@ c@@ tly obey the vo@@ ice of Jehovah your God and care@@ fully ob@@ serve all this command@@ ment that I am giving you today .
For Jehovah your God will bl@@ ess you just as he has promised you . ”
And he na@@ med the second one Eph@@ ra@@ im , for he said , ‘ God has made me fru@@ it@@ ful in the land of my aff@@ li@@ ction . ’ ”
God@@ ’@@ s Word expla@@ ins : “ For the joy that was set before him he end@@ ur@@ ed a tor@@ ture st@@ ake , des@@ p@@ ising sh@@ ame . ”
Jesus certainly found joy in being able to s@@ anc@@ ti@@ fy God@@ ’@@ s name .

For example , Bi@@ anc@@ a from G@@ er@@ many says : “ I cannot than@@ k Jehovah en@@ ough for help@@ ing me with my wor@@ ri@@ es and for being at my side each day .
The world out there is cha@@ o@@ tic and ble@@ ak .
But as I work clo@@ sel@@ y with Jehovah , I feel sec@@ ure in his ar@@ ms .
Wh@@ ene@@ ver I make personal sacrific@@ es for him , he gives me back a hu@@ nd@@ re@@ d@@ f@@ old in blessings . ”
For my own encoura@@ gement , I keep a no@@ te@@ book with s@@ criptu@@ res and thoughts from our public@@ ations that I can cons@@ ult from time to time .
I c@@ all it ‘ My S@@ ur@@ vi@@ val No@@ te@@ book . ’
D@@ is@@ coura@@ gement is tem@@ por@@ ary if we foc@@ us on Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s promises .
Jehovah is always there to help us , regar@@ d@@ less of our circumstances . ”
Yet , you can likely think of ways in which Jehovah has re@@ war@@ ded you and those around you .

( b ) What questions will this article discus@@ s ?
“ But after I started school , I began to pre@@ f@@ er the local language .

I c@@ oul@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t understand the meetings , and I di@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t id@@ enti@@ fy with my parents ’ cul@@ ture . ”
3 , 4 . ( a ) How can parents set a good example for their children ?
( b ) What should parents not exp@@ ect of their children ?
When your children see you “ see@@ king first the Kingdom , ” they learn to de@@ p@@ end on Jehovah for their da@@ ily needs .
N@@ ever get so bus@@ y that you do not have time for your children .
How may your children benefit from lear@@ ning your language ?
Par@@ ents , if that describ@@ es your children , can you learn at le@@ ast some of the local language ?
A child who commun@@ ic@@ ates best in another spo@@ ken language des@@ er@@ ves the same concer@@ n , would you not ag@@ ree ?
If that is your situation , you can still help your children to come to know and love Jehovah .
“ But when we saw her stud@@ ying , pra@@ ying , and doing her best to conduct family worship every wee@@ k , we under@@ sto@@ od that ge@@ tting to know Jehovah was very important . ”
How can parents help children who may need to study in two langu@@ ages ?
( a ) Who must dec@@ ide which language congregation to att@@ end ?
That may not be the case when children do not fully understand the language .
( Read 1 Corinthians 14 : 9 , 11 . )
The answer was not what we person@@ ally found conven@@ i@@ ent .
But when we saw that they were ge@@ tting little benefit from the meetings in our language , we dec@@ ided to move to the local - language congregation .
To@@ gether , we reg@@ ularly attend@@ ed meetings and sh@@ ared in the ministry .
We also inv@@ ited local friends to jo@@ in us for me@@ als and exc@@ ur@@ sions .
All of this helped our children to get to know the brothers and to get to know Jehovah , not only as their God but also as their Father and F@@ ri@@ end .
We consider@@ ed this to be much more important than their ma@@ st@@ ering our language . ”
Samuel ad@@ ds : “ To keep ourselves spiritually strong , my wife and I also attend@@ ed meetings in our language .
Li@@ fe was very bus@@ y , and we were ti@@ red .
But we than@@ k Jehovah for blessing our efforts and sacrific@@ es .
Our three children are all serving Jehovah in the full - time ministry . ”
“ I knew the b@@ asi@@ c@@ s of my parents ’ language , but the language spo@@ ken at the meetings was over my head , ” rec@@ al@@ ls Kris@@ t@@ ina .
“ When I was 12 , I attend@@ ed a conven@@ tion in my school language .
For the first time , I under@@ sto@@ od that what I was hear@@ ing was the truth !
A@@ no@@ ther tur@@ ning point came when I began to pray in my school language .
I could speak to Jehovah from my heart ! ”
Y@@ oung people , do you think that you would pre@@ f@@ er being part of a local - language congregation ?
“ When my si@@ bl@@ ings and I got into our te@@ ens , we wanted to sw@@ it@@ ch to the local - language congregation , ” says Na@@ di@@ a , who now ser@@ ves at Bethel .
“ Now we@@ ’@@ re grat@@ eful that our parents wor@@ ked hard to teach us their language and kept us in the fore@@ ign - language congregation .
It has en@@ ri@@ ch@@ ed our lives and bro@@ ad@@ ened our opport@@ un@@ ities to help others get to know Jehovah . ”
( b ) How can parents get help in teaching their children the truth ?
( Read Proverbs 1 : 8 ; 31 : 10 , 27 , 28 . )
Still , parents who do not know the local language may need help to reach their chil@@ dr@@ en@@ ’@@ s heart .
Bo@@ th children and parents benefit from associ@@ ation with the congregation ( See par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s 18 , 19 )
( b ) What must parents continue to do ?
“ When they helped me with stud@@ ent talk assign@@ ments for the meeting , I always learned more .
And I enjo@@ yed the le@@ is@@ ure activities we sh@@ ared in as a group . ”
Par@@ ents , pray to Jehovah for help , and try your best .
( Read 2 Ch@@ ron@@ ic@@ les 15 : 7 . )
P@@ ut your chil@@ d@@ ’@@ s friend@@ ship with Jehovah a@@ head of your own inter@@ ests .
But it wa@@ s@@ n@@ ’@@ t until 19@@ 46 that I really under@@ sto@@ od Bible truth .
Ev@@ ent@@ ually , I learned si@@ gn language and had fu@@ n pla@@ ying with the other children .
She accep@@ ted a magaz@@ ine sub@@ s@@ crip@@ tion and wanted me to mee@@ t her husband , G@@ ary .
Ev@@ ent@@ ually , fi@@ ve from their clas@@ s became Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
At that time , she gave me a pi@@ ec@@ e of c@@ and@@ y and asked if we could be friends .
When she wanted to get baptized , her parents told her , “ Bec@@ ome one of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , and you will have to leave our home ! ”
She continued her study and later got baptized .
When we got married in 19@@ 60 , her parents did not come to our we@@ d@@ ding .

How can we keep our love for Jehovah strong ?
How can we d@@ eep@@ en our love for Bible truth ?
Why is it important to have aff@@ ection for our brothers ?
What may have ca@@ used the love of some Christians to gro@@ w c@@ old ?
People today have less and less love for God .

S@@ how love for Bible truth ( See par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph 14 )
On his last night on earth , Jesus said to his disciples : “ I am giving you a new command@@ ment , that you love one another ; just as I have loved you , you also love one another .
By this all will know that you are my disciples ​ — if you have love among y@@ ourselves . ” ​ — John 13 : 34 , 35 .
The apostle John wrote : “ The one who does not love his brother , whom he has seen , cannot love God , whom he has not seen . ”
S@@ how love for the brothers and sisters ( See par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph 17 )
What are some ways in which we can show love ?
Read 1 Th@@ ess@@ aloni@@ ans 4 : 9 , 10 .
“ Sim@@ on son of John , do you love me more than these ? ” ​ — J@@ O@@ H@@ N 21 : 15 .
Then he said to them : “ ‘ C@@ ast the ne@@ t on the right side of the bo@@ at and you will find some . ’
So they c@@ ast it , but they were not able to ha@@ ul it in because of the lar@@ ge number of f@@ ish . ” ​ — John 21 : 1 - 6 .
( b ) What valu@@ able less@@ on did a brother in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and learn about his work ?
As a result , it left me al@@ most no time for spiritual matters .
I fin@@ ally reali@@ zed that in order to put Kingdom inter@@ ests first , I needed to change my l@@ ine of work . ”
“ After plan@@ ning for about a year , ” he explained , “ I dec@@ ided to become a st@@ re@@ et v@@ end@@ or and sel@@ l ice cre@@ am .
In the beg@@ in@@ ning , I stru@@ gg@@ led fin@@ anci@@ ally and got disc@@ oura@@ ged .

I pray@@ ed to Jehovah , as@@ king him to help me to cop@@ e and to reach my go@@ al of having more time for spiritual activities .
I got better ac@@ qu@@ a@@ inted with my c@@ us@@ t@@ om@@ ers ’ ta@@ st@@ es and became more s@@ kill@@ ful in making ice cre@@ am .
So@@ on , I was sel@@ ling all my ice cre@@ am every day .
Ac@@ tually , I was better - off fin@@ anci@@ ally than when I wor@@ ked with comp@@ u@@ ters .
It has made me ha@@ p@@ pi@@ er because I do not have the st@@ ress and wor@@ ry that I had with my form@@ er jo@@ b .
And most important , I now feel clo@@ s@@ er to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Matthew 5 : 3 , 6 .
After his bap@@ tism , he said : “ The only re@@ gre@@ t I have is that I lost so much time before I reali@@ zed that serving Jehovah br@@ ings far more happiness than pur@@ su@@ ing the enter@@ tain@@ ment off@@ ered by this world . ”
Jesus stated that “ no one can slave for two ma@@ st@@ ers . ”

Consider the experience of a brother na@@ med Peter .
To t@@ est Peter , the rab@@ b@@ i asked , “ So , my bo@@ y , what language was the book of Daniel written in ? ”
When I went home and c@@ he@@ cked the Watchtower and A@@ wake !
magaz@@ ines from the pre@@ vi@@ ous mon@@ ths , I found an article expla@@ ining that Daniel was written in A@@ ra@@ ma@@ i@@ c . ”
As you do this , you will buil@@ d up “ tre@@ asure in the heavens , where no thi@@ ef ge@@ ts near and no mo@@ th cons@@ um@@ es .
For where your tre@@ asure is , there your hearts will be also . ” ​ — Luke 12 : 33 , 34 .

“ Con@@ t@@ inu@@ e pu@@ tting up with one another and for@@ giving one another f@@ re@@ ely even if anyone has a cause for comp@@ la@@ in@@ t against another . ”
Now they get along well as they preach the good news .
That differ@@ ence may see@@ m un@@ important ; yet , it can lead to serious problems . ”
As my ir@@ rit@@ ation gre@@ w , I started being c@@ ur@@ t with her .
I thought , ‘ She does not show me the respect I des@@ er@@ ve , so I am not going to show her respect . ’ ”
“ I began see@@ ing my own person@@ ality f@@ la@@ ws , and I was very dis@@ appointed in my@@ self .
I reali@@ zed that I had to ad@@ just my thinking .
After pra@@ ying to Jehovah about the matter , I b@@ ought the sister a small gift and wrote her a car@@ d to ap@@ olo@@ gi@@ ze for my bad attitude .
We hu@@ g@@ ged each other and ag@@ re@@ ed to put the matter be@@ h@@ ind us .
We have not had any more problems . ”

If you are gri@@ ev@@ ing , you too can find so@@ o@@ thing comfort from such s@@ criptu@@ res as the following :
( Read 1 Th@@ ess@@ aloni@@ ans 5 : 11 . )
What do we need to remember about gri@@ ef ?
Even when someone does expres@@ s how he feel@@ s , it is not always eas@@ y for others to understand what he is tr@@ ying to say .
At that m@@ om@@ ent , I d@@ on@@ ’@@ t feel qu@@ ite so al@@ one in my gri@@ ef . ”
“ R@@ ec@@ ei@@ ving a shor@@ t encoura@@ ging message or an inv@@ itation to sp@@ end time with a fellow Christian helps me more than I can say , ” says J@@ un@@ ia .
“ Those expres@@ sions make me feel loved and car@@ ed for . ”
“ S@@ ome@@ times when sisters have come to comfort me , ” rec@@ al@@ ls D@@ al@@ ene , “ I have asked them if they are willing to say a prayer .

What pl@@ ans can lead to a happy future for you ?
What could a life in the pioneer service lead to ?
Y@@ O@@ U young ones will pro@@ b@@ ably ag@@ ree that before star@@ ting a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , it is wise to pl@@ an where you will go .
Li@@ fe is like a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , and the time to pl@@ an where you want to go is when you are young .
How do you know that Jehovah wants you to pl@@ an for a happy future ?
Your Creator is “ the God of love , ” “ the happy God , ” who made humans “ in his i@@ ma@@ ge . ”
You will be happy when you imitate our loving God .
Jesus Christ set the perfect example for you young ones .
Jesus also dre@@ w close to Jehovah by stud@@ ying the Scriptures .
“ P@@ l@@ ans fa@@ il when there is no cons@@ ul@@ tation , but there is accomp@@ li@@ sh@@ ment through many ad@@ vis@@ ers . ”
As with any care@@ er , you need time to become s@@ kill@@ ed .
At first , I c@@ oul@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t star@@ t any Bible stu@@ dies , but later I moved to another ter@@ rit@@ ory , and within a mon@@ th I started s@@ ever@@ al stu@@ dies .
One stud@@ ent began coming to the Kingdom H@@ all .
For example , Jac@@ o@@ b , from N@@ or@@ th Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a , wr@@ ites : “ When I was s@@ even , many of my clas@@ s@@ mat@@ es were V@@ i@@ e@@ t@@ na@@ m@@ ese .
I wanted to tell them about Jehovah , so after a while I made pl@@ ans to learn their language .
For the most part , I learned by com@@ par@@ ing the Eng@@ l@@ ish and V@@ i@@ e@@ t@@ na@@ m@@ ese ed@@ itions of The Watchtower .
I also made friends in a ne@@ ar@@ by V@@ i@@ e@@ t@@ na@@ m@@ ese - language congregation .
When I was 18 , I started pione@@ ering .
L@@ ater , I attend@@ ed the Bible S@@ cho@@ ol for S@@ ing@@ le Bro@@ thers .
This helped me with my present pioneer assign@@ ment , where I am the only elder in a V@@ i@@ e@@ t@@ na@@ m@@ ese - language group .
Many V@@ i@@ e@@ t@@ na@@ m@@ ese people are a@@ ma@@ zed that I have learned their language .
They inv@@ ite me in , and often I can study the Bible with them .
Some have prog@@ res@@ sed to bap@@ tism . ” ​ — Com@@ p@@ are Acts 2 : 7 , 8 .
I enjoy encoura@@ ging the young brothers in our congregation and see@@ ing their spiritual prog@@ ress .
After I attend@@ ed the Bible S@@ cho@@ ol for S@@ ing@@ le Bro@@ thers , I received a new pioneer assign@@ ment .
It@@ ’@@ s true that I have never found anyone in the ter@@ rit@@ ory who prog@@ res@@ sed to bap@@ tism , but others have .
How may pioneer service lead to other opport@@ un@@ ities ?
A brother na@@ med K@@ ev@@ in says : “ E@@ ver since I was a little bo@@ y , I have wanted to serve Jehovah full - time some@@ day .
F@@ in@@ ally , I started pione@@ ering when I was 19 .
I sup@@ por@@ ted my@@ self working part - time for a brother who was a buil@@ der .

When I heard about the con@@ stru@@ ction needs in S@@ ou@@ th A@@ fri@@ c@@ a , I ap@@ pli@@ ed and was inv@@ ited to go .
H@@ ere in A@@ fri@@ c@@ a , I move from one Kingdom H@@ all pro@@ ject to another every few wee@@ ks .
We live together , study the Bible together , and work together .
I also enjoy preaching with the local brothers each wee@@ k .
The pl@@ ans I made as a bo@@ y have made me happy in ways I did not for@@ es@@ ee . ”
Bethel service is a happy way of life because everything you do there is for Jehovah .
After a year and a half , I was inv@@ ited to Bethel , where I learned to op@@ er@@ ate prin@@ ting pres@@ ses and later to do comp@@ u@@ ter pro@@ gra@@ m@@ m@@ ing .
At Bethel , I enjoy hear@@ ing fir@@ s@@ th@@ and about the prog@@ ress of the disci@@ ple - making activ@@ ity worl@@ d@@ wide .
I love serving here because what we do helps people to draw close to Jehovah . ”
You can be sure that Jehovah wants you to “ get a fir@@ m hold ” on a happy future .

What can we learn from the example of the prophet Mic@@ ah ?
( Read Mic@@ ah 7 : 1 - 3 . )
If we have faith like that of Mic@@ ah , we will be willing to wa@@ it for Jehovah .
So we “ endure fully with pati@@ ence and joy . ”
Abraham had to wa@@ it many years before his gr@@ and@@ sons E@@ sa@@ u and Jac@@ o@@ b were born ( See par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s 9 , 10 )

( b ) What helped David to wa@@ it pati@@ ently ?
I will sing to Jehovah , for he has ri@@ ch@@ ly re@@ war@@ ded me . ”
( Read 2 Peter 3 : 9 . )
What will help us to be willing to wa@@ it pati@@ ently ?
What less@@ ons do we learn from what happened to the apostle Paul in Ph@@ ili@@ pp@@ i ?
( Read Acts 16 : 8 - 10 . )
So@@ on after he arri@@ ved in M@@ ac@@ ed@@ on@@ ia , he ended up in pris@@ on !
Why did Jehovah allow this to happ@@ en to Paul ?

What will we now discus@@ s and re@@ view together ?
( Read 1 Peter 5 : 6 , 7 . )
S@@ ome@@ times he sur@@ pris@@ es us by doing the un@@ exp@@ ected .
Jehovah sent an ang@@ el to destro@@ y 1@@ 8@@ 5@@ ,000 of S@@ en@@ n@@ ach@@ eri@@ b@@ ’@@ s sol@@ di@@ ers in one night .
( a ) What less@@ on do we learn from what happened to Joseph ?

Th@@ ink , too , about Josep@@ h@@ ’@@ s great - gr@@ and@@ mother S@@ ar@@ ah .
( Read Isaiah 43 : 10 - 13 . )
We know that Jehovah car@@ es for us and wants us to succ@@ eed .
How can we stri@@ p off and keep off the old person@@ ality ?

What helped S@@ te@@ p@@ hen to put away anger and ab@@ usi@@ ve spe@@ ech ?
He says : “ Our family life im@@ proved dra@@ m@@ ati@@ c@@ ally .
Today , S@@ te@@ p@@ hen ser@@ ves as a minis@@ ter@@ i@@ al serv@@ ant , and his wife has been a reg@@ ular pioneer for s@@ ever@@ al years .
Bible t@@ ex@@ ts that encoura@@ ged me were Isaiah 55 : 7 , which says : ‘ Let the wicked man leave his way , ’ and 1 Corinthians 6 : 11 , which says about those who had ab@@ and@@ oned sin@@ ful ways : ‘ And yet that is what some of you were . ’
For many years , Jehovah pati@@ ently helped me by means of his holy spirit to put on the new person@@ ality . ”
We also benefit from God@@ ’@@ s Word and his holy spirit when we pre@@ p@@ are for and att@@ end congregation meetings .
Some of the na@@ m@@ es in this article have been chang@@ ed .

Just as Jehovah f@@ re@@ ely for@@ gave you , you must also do the same . ”
Then he ad@@ ded : “ If you continue show@@ ing fav@@ or@@ it@@ ism , you are comm@@ it@@ ting sin . ”
Why is it important that we clo@@ the ourselves with love ?
Lo@@ ve is also “ pati@@ ent and kind ” and “ does not get pu@@ ff@@ ed up . ”
Paul said that without love , he was “ nothing . ”
The love is in this respect , not that we have loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son as a prop@@ iti@@ at@@ ory sacrifice for our sins . ”
Jesus said : “ No one has love greater than this , that someone should sur@@ rend@@ er his life in be@@ half of his friends . ”
Let us consider how we can do so .
John wrote : “ L@@ it@@ tle children , we should love , not in word or with the t@@ ong@@ ue , but in de@@ ed and truth . ”
But then I asked my@@ self , ‘ How can I imitate Jesus in deal@@ ing with this person ? ’
After refl@@ ec@@ ting on what Jesus would have done , I dec@@ ided to let the matter go and not make an is@@ sue of it .
L@@ ater , I learned that my co@@ work@@ er had been cop@@ ing with a serious health proble@@ m and was under a lo@@ t of st@@ ress .

P@@ E@@ A@@ C@@ E : “ P@@ u@@ tting up with one another in love ” al@@ lo@@ ws us to enjoy “ the un@@ iting b@@ ond of peace . ”
W@@ ould you not ag@@ ree that such a pe@@ ac@@ eful spirit is truly uni@@ qu@@ e in to@@ da@@ y@@ ’@@ s divi@@ ded world ?
Paul wrote : “ Lo@@ ve buil@@ ds up . ”
The following day , they had out@@ gro@@ wn the ven@@ ue . ”

( b ) Why should you be inter@@ ested in what the Bible says about comp@@ as@@ sion ?
( a ) Why did Jehovah s@@ end angels to So@@ dom ?
( Read Ex@@ od@@ us 22 : 26 , 27 . )
We read : “ Jehovah the God of their fore@@ fa@@ thers kept war@@ ning them by means of his mes@@ se@@ ng@@ ers , war@@ ning them again and again , because he felt comp@@ as@@ sion for his people and for his d@@ wel@@ ling place . ”
“ He started to teach them many things . ”
Instead , we need to do all we can now to help people .
One meaning of comp@@ as@@ sion is “ to su@@ ffer together . ”

A brother who has two children wrote : “ Many parents exp@@ end much effort and res@@ our@@ c@@ es help@@ ing their children reach go@@ als in such ar@@ e@@ as as sp@@ or@@ ts , rec@@ re@@ ation , and e@@ duc@@ ation .
It makes so much more sense to exp@@ end effort and res@@ our@@ c@@ es in help@@ ing our children reach go@@ als that will help them to maintain a good standing with Jehovah .
It has been a great s@@ ource of satis@@ fac@@ tion not only to see our children reach spiritual go@@ als but to share the j@@ our@@ ne@@ y with them . ”
Gi@@ ve examples of courage in the Christian congregation .
( a ) How can baptized brothers be coura@@ ge@@ ous ?

Those vers@@ es lik@@ en God@@ ’@@ s Word to a mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r in which we can see ourselves the way Jehovah se@@ es us .
I began to won@@ der if what I saw in my@@ self was different from what Jehovah saw .
At first , I res@@ is@@ ted this new id@@ ea .
I still felt that loving me was too much to exp@@ ect of Jehovah .
“ A few days later , I read a s@@ crip@@ ture that chang@@ ed my life .
The verse was Isaiah 1 : 18 , where Jehovah is qu@@ o@@ ted as saying : ‘ C@@ ome , now , you people , and let us set matters st@@ ra@@ i@@ ght between us . . . .
Tho@@ u@@ gh the sins of you people should prove to be as s@@ car@@ let , they will be made wh@@ ite just like s@@ now . ’
I felt as if Jehovah were speaking to me , saying : ‘ C@@ ome on , V@@ ic@@ k@@ y , let@@ ’@@ s set matters st@@ ra@@ i@@ ght between us .
I know you , I know your sins , I know your heart ​ — and I love you . ’
“ I was u@@ na@@ ble to s@@ le@@ e@@ p that night .
I still doub@@ ted that Jehovah could love me , but I began thinking about Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice .
All of a su@@ d@@ den , it da@@ w@@ ned on me that Jehovah had been pati@@ ent with me for so long , show@@ ing me that he loved me in so many ways .
Yet , I was , in effect , saying to him : ‘ Your love is not great en@@ ough to reach me .
Your S@@ on@@ ’@@ s sacrifice is not en@@ ough to c@@ over me . ’
It was as if I had been th@@ ro@@ wing the ransom back at Jehovah .
But now , at last , by med@@ it@@ ating on this gift of the ransom , I began to feel loved by Jehovah . ”

We are the only Witnesses they are ex@@ posed to .
So the way we act can deter@@ m@@ ine how they will respond .

So ask yourself , ‘ Do I know Jehovah as well as Noah , Daniel , and Job did ? ’
No@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s great - gr@@ and@@ father E@@ no@@ ch also “ kept wal@@ king with the true God . ”
Jesus said : “ Abraham your father rejo@@ ic@@ ed great@@ ly at the prosp@@ ect of see@@ ing my day . ”

( Read 1 Peter 3 : 20 , 21 . )
Why do we not pres@@ sure anyone to get baptized ?
If you are a par@@ ent , you may have asked yourself : ‘ Is my child really ready to get baptized ?
The first question is , “ On the bas@@ is of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ , have you rep@@ ented of your sins and dedic@@ ated yourself to Jehovah to do his will ? ”
How can we be ho@@ sp@@ it@@ able at our Christian meetings ?

Because of my past , I found it difficult to feel wor@@ thy of God@@ ’@@ s love .
Tim@@ e and time again , however , Jehovah has used the congregation and the elders to con@@ fir@@ m his love for me .
I pray that I will never let him go . ”

This time , however , they inv@@ ited me to come to a C@@ ong@@ reg@@ ation Bo@@ ok St@@ ud@@ y , a small meeting for Bible study and discus@@ sion that was hel@@ d in their home .
I told them I would think about it .
I c@@ oul@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t believe how much they knew about the Bible !
Y@@ ear@@ s before , when I asked my mother about Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , she simply said , “ O@@ h , they worship some old man na@@ med Jehovah . ”
But I now felt that my eyes were being op@@ ened !
I started pione@@ ering the next year , in 195@@ 8 .

I told the of@@ fic@@ er that I had already been in pris@@ on because I would not fi@@ ght .
I W@@ A@@ S born in 19@@ 26 in C@@ ro@@ ok@@ s@@ v@@ il@@ le , O@@ hi@@ o , in the United States .
Father and M@@ other were not religious , but they told us ei@@ ght children to go to c@@ hurch .
Mar@@ gar@@ et W@@ al@@ k@@ er ( second sister from the left ) helped me learn the truth
Ab@@ out that time , a neigh@@ b@@ or na@@ med Mar@@ gar@@ et W@@ al@@ k@@ er , one of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , began vis@@ iting my mother and tal@@ king to her about the Bible .
But I kept tr@@ ying to listen to their discus@@ sions .
After a couple more vis@@ its , Mar@@ gar@@ et asked me , “ Do you know what God@@ ’@@ s name is ? ”
I said , “ E@@ ver@@ yone kno@@ ws that ​ — it@@ ’@@ s God . ”
She said , “ G@@ et your Bible and look up Psalm 8@@ 3 : 18 . ”
I did , and I disc@@ over@@ ed that God@@ ’@@ s name is Jehovah .
I ra@@ n out to my friends and told them , “ When you get home t@@ oni@@ ght , look up Psalm 8@@ 3 : 18 in the Bible and see what God@@ ’@@ s name is . ”
You might say I started w@@ itness@@ ing right away .
I stu@@ died the Bible and got baptized in 19@@ 41 .
So@@ on af@@ ter@@ ward , I was assign@@ ed to conduct a congregation book study .
I encoura@@ ged my mother and si@@ bl@@ ings to come , and they all began attend@@ ing the book study that I conduc@@ ted .
S@@ ome@@ times when she was on her way , he cha@@ sed after her and p@@ ul@@ led her back into the house .
But she would just ru@@ n out the other do@@ or and go to the meeting .
I also told the of@@ fici@@ als that I would not become a sol@@ di@@ er .
In cour@@ t two wee@@ ks later , the jud@@ ge said : “ If it were up to me , I@@ ’@@ d give you a life s@@ ent@@ ence .
I re@@ pli@@ ed : “ Your H@@ on@@ or , I should have been clas@@ si@@ fied as a minis@@ ter .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one@@ ’@@ s do@@ or@@ ste@@ p is my p@@ ul@@ p@@ it , and I have pre@@ ached the good news of the Kingdom to many people . ”

I was among the Witnesses im@@ pris@@ oned for ne@@ u@@ tr@@ ality at A@@ sh@@ land , K@@ ent@@ u@@ ck@@ y
That is how we pre@@ ached in an organi@@ zed way .
I wor@@ ri@@ ed about my family because D@@ ad had told me , “ If I can get ri@@ d of you , I can hand@@ le the res@@ t . ”
After my r@@ ele@@ ase , I had a pleas@@ ant sur@@ pris@@ e .

I qu@@ o@@ ted 2 Timothy 2 : 3 and said , “ I am already a sol@@ di@@ er of Christ . ”
After a long s@@ il@@ ence , he said , “ You can leave . ”
So@@ on af@@ ter@@ ward , I attend@@ ed the Bethel meeting at a conven@@ tion in C@@ inc@@ in@@ n@@ ati , O@@ hi@@ o .
I also wor@@ ked at As@@ se@@ mb@@ ly H@@ al@@ ls in New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity .
I have made many friends at Bethel and in the congregation .
I have learned a little M@@ and@@ ar@@ in Ch@@ in@@ ese and enjoy appro@@ aching Ch@@ in@@ ese people on the st@@ re@@ et .
Some mor@@ n@@ ings I place 30 or 40 magaz@@ ines with inter@@ ested ones .
P@@ re@@ aching to the Ch@@ in@@ ese people in Bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n , New Y@@ or@@ k
I have even made a return vis@@ it in Ch@@ ina !
She took them and told me that her name was K@@ ati@@ e .
After that , wh@@ ene@@ ver she saw me , K@@ ati@@ e came over to talk to me .
I taught her the na@@ m@@ es of fru@@ its and ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les in Eng@@ l@@ ish , and she re@@ pe@@ ated the words after me .
I also explained Bible t@@ ex@@ ts to her , and she accep@@ ted the Bible T@@ each book .
After some wee@@ ks , though , she dis@@ appe@@ ared .
The next wee@@ k , she hand@@ ed me her c@@ el@@ l p@@ hone and said , “ You talk to Ch@@ ina . ”
I said , “ I d@@ on@@ ’@@ t know any@@ body in Ch@@ ina . ”
But she in@@ sis@@ ted , so I took the p@@ hone and said , “ H@@ el@@ l@@ o , this is R@@ ob@@ is@@ on . ”
The vo@@ ice at the other end said , “ R@@ ob@@ by , this is K@@ ati@@ e .
P@@ le@@ ase teach her the way you taught me . ”
I said , “ K@@ ati@@ e , I will do the best I can .
T@@ han@@ ks for let@@ ting me know where you are . ”
So@@ on af@@ ter@@ ward , I spoke to K@@ ati@@ e@@ ’@@ s sister for the last time .
