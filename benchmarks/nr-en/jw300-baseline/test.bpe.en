TH@@ IS M@@ AG@@ AZ@@ IN@@ E , The Watchtower , hon@@ ors Jehovah God , the R@@ ul@@ er of the un@@ iver@@ se .
It com@@ forts people with the good news that G@@ od@@ ’@@ s heavenly Kingdom will soon end all wic@@ k@@ ed@@ ness and trans@@ form the earth into a par@@ adise .
It prom@@ ot@@ es faith in Jesus Christ , who died so that we might gain everlasting life and who is now rul@@ ing as King of G@@ od@@ ’@@ s Kingdom .
This mag@@ az@@ ine has been publis@@ hed continu@@ ously since 1@@ 8@@ 7@@ 9 and is n@@ on@@ pol@@ it@@ ical .
It ad@@ her@@ es to the Bible as its author@@ ity .
It is prov@@ ided as part of a world@@ wide Bible ed@@ uc@@ ati@@ onal work suppor@@ ted by v@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ary d@@ on@@ ations .
To make a d@@ on@@ ation , ple@@ ase vis@@ it w@@ w@@ w.@@ j@@ w.@@ or@@ g .
Un@@ less oth@@ er@@ wise indic@@ ated , Script@@ ure qu@@ ot@@ ations are from the mod@@ er@@ n - language New World Tr@@ ans@@ l@@ ation of the H@@ o@@ ly Scriptures .
B@@ ebe had been very close to her father .
The re@@ mar@@ k came from a well - meaning family friend , but B@@ ebe found it more c@@ ut@@ ting than com@@ for@@ ting .
“ His death was@@ n@@ ’@@ t for the best , ” she kept re@@ pe@@ ating to her@@ self .
It was clear that when B@@ ebe rec@@ oun@@ ted the inc@@ id@@ ent in a book years later , she was still g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing .
As B@@ ebe came to see , it can take a long time for someone to over@@ come g@@ ri@@ ef , especially when the b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed person was very close to the dec@@ eas@@ ed .
In the Bible , death is ap@@ tly describ@@ ed as “ the last enem@@ y . ”
It b@@ re@@ ak@@ s into our lives with ir@@ res@@ ist@@ ible for@@ ce , often when we are comple@@ t@@ ely un@@ pre@@ par@@ ed , and it ro@@ b@@ s us of those we hold de@@ ar .
Per@@ haps you have wond@@ ered : ‘ How long does it take to get over g@@ ri@@ ef ?
How can I comfort others who have been b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed ?
Is there any hope for our loved ones who have died ? ’
H@@ ave you ever had a b@@ ri@@ ef b@@ out with ill@@ ness ?
As an example , consider how the p@@ at@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch Abraham re@@ ac@@ ted when his wife died .
The Bible says that “ Abraham began to m@@ our@@ n and to w@@ eep over S@@ ar@@ ah . ”
The expres@@ sion “ began to ” s@@ ugg@@ ests that it took some time for him to cop@@ e with his lo@@ s@@ s .
He g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ed for “ many days , ” and his family members were un@@ able to comfort him .
S@@ ever@@ al years later , the death of Joseph still we@@ igh@@ ed heav@@ ily on his mind . ​ — Genesis 23 : 2 ; 37 : 34 , 35 ; 42 : 36 ; 45 : 28 .
“ My husband , R@@ ob@@ ert , died on J@@ uly 9 , 200@@ 8 .
S@@ i@@ x years later the p@@ ain in my heart is still there .
I d@@ on@@ ’@@ t think I will ever get over my lo@@ s@@ s of R@@ o@@ b . ” ​ — G@@ a@@ il , ag@@ ed 60 .
“ Although I have been without my de@@ ar wife for more than 18 years , I still mis@@ s her and g@@ ri@@ eve over my lo@@ s@@ s .
Wh@@ en@@ ever I see something in n@@ ature that is at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive , my though@@ ts go to her , and I cannot help wond@@ ering how she would have enjoy@@ ed se@@ e@@ ing what I am se@@ e@@ ing . ” ​ — E@@ ti@@ en@@ ne , ag@@ ed 8@@ 4 .
C@@ learly , such p@@ ain@@ ful and long - lasting feelings are only n@@ at@@ ural .
E@@ ach person g@@ ri@@ ev@@ es in his or her own way , and it would be un@@ wise to jud@@ ge the way another person respon@@ ds to tr@@ ag@@ ed@@ y .
At the same time , we may need to hold off from cond@@ em@@ ning ourselves if our re@@ action to lo@@ s@@ s se@@ ems exc@@ es@@ si@@ ve .
As we note in the “ Im@@ it@@ ate The@@ ir F@@ a@@ ith ” article in this is@@ sue , Isa@@ a@@ c was still g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing over the lo@@ s@@ s of his mother , S@@ ar@@ ah , three years after her death . ​ — Genesis 24 : 6@@ 7 .
For inst@@ ance , you may find that some will adv@@ ise you not to cr@@ y or show your feelings in any way .
O@@ th@@ ers may p@@ us@@ h you to do the op@@ pos@@ ite and ex@@ pose all your feelings .
The Bible pres@@ ents a more bal@@ anc@@ ed view , one that is suppor@@ ted by mod@@ er@@ n res@@ ear@@ ch .
In some cul@@ t@@ ures it is consid@@ ered un@@ man@@ ly for a m@@ ale to cr@@ y .
But is there a real need to feel as@@ ha@@ m@@ ed about she@@ d@@ ding t@@ ears , even in pub@@ lic ?
M@@ ent@@ al - heal@@ th ex@@ per@@ ts ac@@ knowledge that t@@ ear@@ ful@@ ness is a nor@@ m@@ al part of g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing .
And g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing may , in time , help you to move on des@@ pite the en@@ or@@ m@@ ity of your lo@@ s@@ s .
S@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sing g@@ ri@@ ef , however , may do more har@@ m than good .
The Bible l@@ end@@ s no support to the no@@ tion that it is wrong or un@@ man@@ ly to sh@@ ed t@@ ears of g@@ ri@@ ef .
At the death of his de@@ ar friend L@@ az@@ ar@@ us , Jesus op@@ en@@ ly we@@ p@@ t , even though he had the power to bring the dead back to life ! ​ — John 11 : 33 - 35 .
B@@ ou@@ ts of anger are often part of g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing , especially in c@@ as@@ es of s@@ ud@@ den , un@@ expec@@ ted death .
There are many reas@@ ons why a b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed person may feel ang@@ ry , such as when though@@ tl@@ ess and un@@ fo@@ und@@ ed comm@@ ents are made by a resp@@ ec@@ ted person .
* This ang@@ ered me because we des@@ per@@ ately needed our father .
E@@ spec@@ ially in the case of un@@ expec@@ ted death , the b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed person may re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly think , ‘ It might not have happ@@ ened if only I had done this or that . ’
If you are being pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed by such feelings of gu@@ il@@ t and anger , it is important not to bo@@ t@@ tle up these em@@ o@@ tions .
Rather , speak to a friend who will listen and re@@ ass@@ ure you that such ir@@ r@@ ati@@ onal feelings are comm@@ on to many b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed ones .
The Bible rem@@ ind@@ s us : “ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of distr@@ ess . ” ​ — Proverbs 17 : 17 .
The best F@@ ri@@ end a b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed person can have is our Creator , Jehovah God .
P@@ our out your heart to him in prayer because “ he car@@ es for you . ”
M@@ ore@@ over , he promises that all who do so will have their though@@ ts and feelings so@@ oth@@ ed by “ the peace of God that sur@@ p@@ as@@ ses all understanding . ”
Al@@ so , allow God to help you he@@ al by means of his con@@ sol@@ ing Word , the Bible .
H@@ av@@ ing such though@@ ts to p@@ on@@ der over may be especially help@@ ful at night when you are al@@ one and find it hard to s@@ le@@ ep . ​ — Isaiah 5@@ 7 : 15 .
R@@ ec@@ ently , a 40 - year - old man , whom we will c@@ all J@@ ack , lo@@ st his bel@@ ov@@ ed wife to c@@ anc@@ er .
“ When I pray to Jehovah , ” he expl@@ ains , “ I never feel al@@ one .
I often w@@ ake up during the night and cannot get back to s@@ le@@ ep .
After reading and medit@@ ating on com@@ for@@ ting though@@ ts from the Scriptures and then p@@ our@@ ing out the feelings of my heart in prayer , I sense a c@@ al@@ m@@ ness and a trans@@ c@@ ending peace come over me , p@@ ut@@ ting my mind and heart at res@@ t and en@@ ab@@ ling me to s@@ le@@ ep . ”
A young woman nam@@ ed V@@ an@@ ess@@ a lo@@ st her mother to ill@@ ness .
She too has experienced the power of prayer .
“ In my most difficult times , ” she says , “ I would just c@@ all on G@@ od@@ ’@@ s name and b@@ re@@ ak down in t@@ ears .
Jehovah list@@ ened to my prayers and always gave me the strength I needed . ”
Some b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ement coun@@ sel@@ ors adv@@ ise those who are str@@ ug@@ gl@@ ing with g@@ ri@@ ef to get involved in helping others or to v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er their time in some comm@@ unity service .
Do@@ ing so can bring joy and may e@@ ase a person@@ ’@@ s g@@ ri@@ ef .
Many b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed Christians have found that working to help others has brought them great comfort . ​ — 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 .
God feel@@ s for you in your p@@ ain . ​ — Psalm 5@@ 5 : 22 ; 1 Peter 5 : 7 .
God pati@@ ently list@@ ens to the prayers of his servants . ​ — Psalm 8@@ 6 : 5 ; 1 Th@@ ess@@ alon@@ ians 5 : 17 .
God mis@@ ses people who have died . ​ — Job 14 : 13 - 15 .
God promises to resurrec@@ t the dead . ​ — Isaiah 26 : 19 ; John 5 : 28 , 29 .
H@@ ave you ever felt hel@@ pl@@ ess when someone near to you was g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing over the lo@@ s@@ s of a loved one ?
Som@@ e@@ times we may feel un@@ sure of what to say or do ​ — so we w@@ ind up saying and doing nothing .
But there are practic@@ al , help@@ ful things that we can do .
O@@ f@@ ten , all that is needed is your pres@@ ence al@@ ong with a sim@@ ple expres@@ sion , such as “ I am so sor@@ ry . ”
In many cul@@ t@@ ures , giving the person a hu@@ g or a g@@ ent@@ le s@@ qu@@ e@@ eze of the ar@@ m is an ef@@ fec@@ tive way to show you care .
If the b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed one wants to talk , listen sy@@ m@@ p@@ ath@@ e@@ tic@@ ally .
B@@ est of all , do something for the b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed family , per@@ haps per@@ form@@ ing a cho@@ re the g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing one has not been able to care for , such as co@@ ok@@ ing a me@@ al , car@@ ing for the children , or helping with f@@ un@@ er@@ al arrang@@ em@@ ents if that is des@@ ir@@ ed .
S@@ uch actions may speak l@@ ou@@ der than the most el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent words .
In time , you may be moved to talk about the dec@@ eas@@ ed , per@@ haps foc@@ using on some good qualities or happy experi@@ ences .
S@@ uch con@@ vers@@ ation may even bring a sm@@ ile to the b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed person@@ ’@@ s face .
For example , P@@ am ​ — who lo@@ st her husband , I@@ an , si@@ x years ag@@ o — ​ says : “ Pe@@ ople some@@ times tell me good things that I@@ an did that I never knew about , and that makes my heart feel good . ”
R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers re@@ por@@ t that many b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed people receive a lo@@ t of in@@ it@@ ial help but that their needs are soon for@@ go@@ t@@ ten as friends get bus@@ y again with their own lives .
Th@@ er@@ efore , make a point of cont@@ ac@@ ting a b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed friend on a reg@@ ular basi@@ s after the lo@@ s@@ s .
* Many g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing ones deep@@ ly appreci@@ ate this opportunity to reli@@ eve themselves of pro@@ long@@ ed feelings of g@@ ri@@ ef .
Consider the example of Ka@@ or@@ i , a young J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese woman who was dev@@ ast@@ ated by the lo@@ s@@ s of her mother follow@@ ed by the lo@@ s@@ s of her older sister 15 mon@@ ths later .
Th@@ an@@ k@@ fully , she received ong@@ o@@ ing support from loyal friends .
One nam@@ ed R@@ it@@ s@@ uko is much older than Ka@@ or@@ i and of@@ fered to be her close friend .
“ To be hon@@ est , ” says Ka@@ or@@ i , “ I was@@ n@@ ’@@ t happy about that .
I d@@ id@@ n@@ ’@@ t want anyone to take the place of my mother , and I d@@ id@@ n@@ ’@@ t think that anyone could .
However , because of the way M@@ ama R@@ it@@ s@@ uko tre@@ ated me , I came to feel close to her .
E@@ very w@@ ee@@ k , we went out in the ev@@ ang@@ eliz@@ ing work together and went to Christian meetings together .
She inv@@ ited me to have te@@ a with her , brought me me@@ als , and wrote me let@@ ters and car@@ ds many times .
M@@ ama R@@ it@@ s@@ uk@@ o@@ ’@@ s pos@@ it@@ ive attitude had a good influ@@ ence on me . ”
T@@ wel@@ ve years have pass@@ ed since Ka@@ or@@ i@@ ’@@ s mother died , and today she and her husband are full - time ev@@ ang@@ eliz@@ ers .
“ M@@ ama R@@ it@@ s@@ uko , ” Ka@@ or@@ i says , “ continu@@ es to show her concer@@ n .
When I go back home , I always vis@@ it her and enjoy her up@@ bu@@ ild@@ ing associ@@ ation . ”
A@@ no@@ ther example of someone who benef@@ ited from ong@@ o@@ ing support is P@@ ol@@ i , one of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses in C@@ y@@ pr@@ us .
P@@ ol@@ i had a kind husband , S@@ oz@@ o@@ s , who set a good example as a Christian shepher@@ d by often inv@@ iting or@@ ph@@ ans and w@@ id@@ ow@@ s to their home for associ@@ ation and a me@@ al .
S@@ ad@@ ly , at the age of 5@@ 3 , S@@ oz@@ o@@ s died of a b@@ ra@@ in t@@ um@@ or .
There , they began associ@@ ating with a congregation of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
“ The friends in my new congregation , ” rec@@ all@@ s P@@ ol@@ i , “ did not know anything about our past and our difficult circumstances .
But that did not st@@ op them from appro@@ aching us and emb@@ r@@ ac@@ ing us with their kind words and practic@@ al help .
How prec@@ ious that help was , especially at that time , when my son needed his father most !
Those taking the lead in the congregation showed a great de@@ al of personal interest in Daniel .
One in par@@ tic@@ ular made sure to incl@@ ude Daniel when enjoy@@ ing associ@@ ation with friends or when going out to pl@@ ay b@@ all . ”
B@@ o@@ th mother and son are doing well today .
To be sure , there are many ways we can off@@ er practic@@ al help and comfort to those who m@@ our@@ n .
The Bible also com@@ forts us by means of a thr@@ ill@@ ing hope for the future .
Some have even mar@@ ked the d@@ ate of the death on their c@@ al@@ end@@ ar as a rem@@ ind@@ er to off@@ er comfort when it may be most needed ​ — on or near the d@@ ate of the lo@@ s@@ s .
You may rec@@ all that G@@ a@@ il , mentioned ear@@ li@@ er in this ser@@ ies , doub@@ ts whether she will ever get over the death of her husband , R@@ o@@ b .
However , she is look@@ ing for@@ ward to se@@ e@@ ing him again in G@@ od@@ ’@@ s promised new world .
My feelings really go out to people who have lo@@ st someone they love but who are not aw@@ are of this hope of se@@ e@@ ing their loved one again . ”
S@@ o@@ on , God will do just that ​ — for Job and coun@@ tl@@ ess others — ​ when this earth is trans@@ form@@ ed into a par@@ adise .
“ There is going to be a resurrection , ” the Bible con@@ fir@@ m@@ s at Acts 24 : 15 .
“ Do not be amaz@@ ed at this , ” Jesus ass@@ ures us , “ for the ho@@ ur is coming in which all those in the m@@ emor@@ ial t@@ omb@@ s will he@@ ar his v@@ o@@ ice and come out . ”
He will have the pro@@ sp@@ ect of reg@@ aining “ his you@@ th@@ ful v@@ ig@@ or , ” and his fles@@ h will forever remain “ f@@ res@@ her than in you@@ th . ”
The same will happ@@ en to all who resp@@ ond with appreciation to G@@ od@@ ’@@ s m@@ erc@@ if@@ ul prov@@ ision of a resurrection to life on earth .
If you have suf@@ fered the lo@@ s@@ s of someone de@@ ar to you , the information we have discus@@ sed may not comple@@ t@@ ely take away your g@@ ri@@ ef .
But by medit@@ ating on G@@ od@@ ’@@ s promises found in the Bible , you can find real hope and the strength to keep going . ​ — 1 Th@@ ess@@ alon@@ ians 4 : 13 .

C@@ OV@@ ER S@@ UB@@ JE@@ C@@ T | W@@ H@@ Y D@@ I@@ D J@@ ES@@ U@@ S S@@ U@@ F@@ F@@ ER AN@@ D D@@ I@@ E ?
In the sp@@ ring of 33 C@@ .@@ E . , Jesus the N@@ az@@ ar@@ ene was ex@@ ecu@@ ted .
He had been fal@@ sel@@ y c@@ har@@ ged with se@@ d@@ ition , s@@ av@@ ag@@ ely be@@ at@@ en , and n@@ ail@@ ed to a st@@ ake .
But God ra@@ ised him back to life , and 40 days later , Jesus as@@ c@@ ended to heaven .
This ex@@ tr@@ a@@ ord@@ in@@ ary account comes to us from the four G@@ os@@ p@@ els of the Christian Gre@@ ek Scriptures , comm@@ only called the New T@@ est@@ am@@ ent .
On the other hand , if those events really did happ@@ en , then there is a b@@ right future for mankind , one in which you can share .
So , are the G@@ os@@ pe@@ l acc@@ oun@@ ts fact or fic@@ tion ?
Un@@ like f@@ anc@@ if@@ ul leg@@ end@@ s , the G@@ os@@ pe@@ l writ@@ ings reflec@@ t p@@ ain@@ st@@ aking acc@@ ur@@ ac@@ y and attention to de@@ t@@ a@@ il .
For example , they ab@@ ound with nam@@ es of real plac@@ es , many of which can be vis@@ ited today .
They tell about real people , who@@ se ex@@ ist@@ ence has been cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ated by sec@@ ular h@@ is@@ tor@@ ians . ​ — Luke 3 : 1 , 2 , 23 .
Jesus himself is mentioned by sec@@ ular writ@@ ers of the first and sec@@ ond centur@@ ies .
* His man@@ ner of death , as describ@@ ed in the G@@ os@@ p@@ els , ag@@ re@@ es with Rom@@ an ex@@ ecu@@ ti@@ onal m@@ eth@@ od@@ s of the time .
M@@ ore@@ over , events are rel@@ ated in a fac@@ t@@ ual and c@@ and@@ id man@@ ner ​ — even por@@ tr@@ aying some of Jesus ’ disciples un@@ fav@@ or@@ ab@@ ly .
All these fac@@ tor@@ s str@@ ong@@ ly indic@@ ate that the G@@ os@@ pe@@ l writ@@ ers were hon@@ est and acc@@ ur@@ ate in what they wrote about Jesus .
While it is gener@@ ally accep@@ ted that Jesus lived and died , some would question his resurrection .
Even his apostles did not believe the in@@ it@@ ial re@@ por@@ t of his having re@@ turned to life .
All doubt was rem@@ ov@@ ed , however , when they and other disciples saw the resurrec@@ ted Jesus on se@@ par@@ ate occasi@@ ons .
In fact , in one case , there were more than 5@@ 00 ey@@ ew@@ itnesses present . ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 6 .
At the ris@@ k of being ar@@ res@@ ted and kill@@ ed , the disciples cour@@ ag@@ e@@ ously pro@@ cla@@ im@@ ed Jesus ’ resurrection to all ​ — even to the very ones who had ex@@ ecu@@ ted him .
Would so many disciples have been so b@@ old if they were not ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely sure that Jesus had really been resurrec@@ ted ?
In fact , the re@@ ality of the resurrection of Jesus is the dr@@ iving for@@ ce be@@ h@@ ind the im@@ p@@ act that Christi@@ an@@ ity has had on the world both then and now .
The G@@ os@@ pe@@ l acc@@ oun@@ ts of Jesus ’ death and resurrection be@@ ar all the nec@@ ess@@ ary mar@@ ks of an auth@@ enti@@ c h@@ is@@ tor@@ ical rec@@ ord .
C@@ ar@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly reading them will conv@@ in@@ ce you that these events really happ@@ ened .
Your conv@@ ic@@ tion can be f@@ ur@@ ther streng@@ th@@ ened when you understand why they took place .
T@@ ac@@ it@@ us , born about 5@@ 5 C@@ .@@ E . , wrote that “ Chris@@ t@@ us , from whom the name [ Christians ] had its or@@ ig@@ in , suf@@ fered the ex@@ tre@@ me p@@ en@@ al@@ ty during the re@@ ign of T@@ ib@@ er@@ i@@ us at the h@@ ands of one of our pro@@ c@@ ur@@ at@@ ors , P@@ on@@ ti@@ us P@@ il@@ at@@ us . ”
Jesus is also refer@@ red to by S@@ u@@ et@@ on@@ i@@ us ( first century ) ; Je@@ wish h@@ is@@ tor@@ ian Jos@@ eph@@ us ( first century ) ; and P@@ lin@@ y the Y@@ ou@@ ng@@ er , gover@@ nor of B@@ ith@@ y@@ n@@ ia ( early sec@@ ond century ) .
Then , too , it is un@@ likely that Jesus ’ many op@@ pos@@ ers would wr@@ ite anything that would l@@ end cre@@ d@@ ib@@ ility to the re@@ por@@ ts about him .
R@@ eg@@ arding Jesus ’ resurrection , Peter , one of his apostles , expl@@ ained : “ God ra@@ ised this one up on the th@@ ir@@ d day and allow@@ ed him to become man@@ if@@ est , not to all the people , but to w@@ itnesses appointed be@@ fore@@ hand by God , to us , who ate and dr@@ an@@ k with him after his ris@@ ing from the dead . ”
Matthe@@ w@@ ’@@ s G@@ os@@ pe@@ l tel@@ ls us that when the religious enem@@ ies heard re@@ por@@ ts of Jesus ’ resurrection , they s@@ ch@@ em@@ ed to su@@ pp@@ ress them . ​ — Matthew 28 : 11 - 15 .
Does this mean that Jesus wanted his resurrection to be kept sec@@ re@@ t ?
No , for Peter went on to say : “ He ord@@ ered us to preach to the people and to give a th@@ or@@ ough w@@ itness that this is the one dec@@ re@@ ed by God to be jud@@ ge of the living and the dead . ”
Tr@@ ue Christians have done and are doing just that . ​ — Acts 10 : 42 .
“ Th@@ r@@ ough one man [ Adam ] sin ent@@ ered into the world and death through sin . ” ​ — Romans 5 : 12
What would you say if you were asked , “ Do you want to live forever ? ”
M@@ ost people would pro@@ bab@@ ly say that they want to but that they feel it is un@@ re@@ alis@@ tic to consider it .
De@@ ath is a nor@@ m@@ al part of life , they say , the n@@ at@@ ural out@@ come of our ex@@ ist@@ ence .
S@@ u@@ pp@@ ose , though , that the question were turned around and you were asked , “ Are you ready to di@@ e ? ”
U@@ nd@@ er nor@@ m@@ al circumstances , most people would answer no .
The Bible shows that God cre@@ ated humans with the desire and the will to live .
In fact , it says that “ he has even put e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity in their heart . ” ​ — Ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ ast@@ es 3 : 11 .
The re@@ ality , though , is that humans do not live forever .
F@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , has God done anything to rem@@ ed@@ y the situation ?
The B@@ ib@@ le@@ ’@@ s answ@@ ers are hear@@ t@@ ening , and they have a direc@@ t be@@ ar@@ ing on why Jesus suf@@ fered and died .
The first three cha@@ pt@@ ers of the Bible book of Genesis tell us that God set before the first human couple , Adam and Eve , the pro@@ sp@@ ect of un@@ ending life and told them what they would have to do to gain it .
Then the account describ@@ es how they fa@@ il@@ ed to obey God and lo@@ st that pro@@ sp@@ ect .
The st@@ ory is told sim@@ ply ​ — so sim@@ ply that some are qu@@ ic@@ k to dis@@ mis@@ s it as fol@@ k@@ l@@ ore .
But Genesis , like the G@@ os@@ p@@ els , gives every ind@@ ication of being a fac@@ t@@ ual , h@@ is@@ tor@@ ical rec@@ ord .
What has been the result of Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s fa@@ il@@ ure to obey ?
The Bible answ@@ ers this way : “ Th@@ r@@ ough one man [ Adam ] sin ent@@ ered into the world and death through sin , and so death sp@@ read to all men because they had all sin@@ ned . ”
He thus lo@@ st the pro@@ sp@@ ect of endl@@ ess life and ev@@ ent@@ ually died .
Be@@ ing his des@@ c@@ end@@ ants , we have in@@ her@@ ited his sin@@ ful cond@@ ition .
But has God done anything to rem@@ ed@@ y the situation ?
Yes , God made arrang@@ em@@ ents to re@@ d@@ ee@@ m , or bu@@ y back , what Adam had lo@@ st for his des@@ c@@ end@@ ants , nam@@ ely , the pro@@ sp@@ ect of endl@@ ess life .
“ The wa@@ g@@ es sin p@@ ays is death , ” says the Bible at Romans 6 : 23 .
This means that death is the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of sin .
L@@ ik@@ ew@@ ise , we sin and are ther@@ efore sub@@ ject to sin@@ ’@@ s wa@@ g@@ es , death .
But we were born in this sin@@ ful cond@@ ition through no fa@@ ult of our own .
So God lov@@ ingly sent his Son , Jesus , to accept ‘ the wa@@ g@@ es of sin ’ for us .
Jesus ’ death op@@ ens the way to a happy , endl@@ ess life
Sin@@ ce one man , the perfect man Adam , brought sin and death on us through dis@@ obedi@@ ence , a perfect man obedi@@ ent even t@@ ill death was needed to rel@@ e@@ ase us from that bur@@ den .
The Bible expl@@ ains it this way : “ J@@ ust as through the dis@@ obedi@@ ence of the one man many were made sin@@ n@@ ers , so also through the obedi@@ ence of the one person many will be made righteous . ”
He left heaven , became a perfect man * , and died in our be@@ half .
As a result , it is possible for us to have a righteous stand@@ ing with God and gain the pro@@ sp@@ ect of endl@@ ess life .
Why , though , was it nec@@ ess@@ ary for Jesus to di@@ e to ac@@ compl@@ ish this ?
C@@ ould not Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty God have sim@@ ply is@@ su@@ ed a dec@@ ree that Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s des@@ c@@ end@@ ants be allow@@ ed to live forever ?
H@@ ad God set jus@@ tice asi@@ de in this inst@@ ance , people might have wond@@ ered whether he would do so in other matters as well .
For example , would he be fa@@ ir in determin@@ ing who among Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s off@@ sp@@ ring qual@@ if@@ y for e@@ ter@@ n@@ al life ?
C@@ ould he be tr@@ us@@ ted to keep his promises ?
G@@ od@@ ’@@ s ad@@ her@@ ence to jus@@ tice in working out our sal@@ v@@ ation is ass@@ ur@@ ance to us that he will always do what is right .
By Jesus ’ sacrif@@ ic@@ ial death , God op@@ ened the way to endl@@ ess life in Par@@ adise on earth .
No@@ te Jesus ’ words as rec@@ ord@@ ed at John 3 : 16 : “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - beg@@ ot@@ ten Son , so that every@@ one exerc@@ is@@ ing faith in him might not be destro@@ y@@ ed but have everlasting life . ”
Jesus ’ death is thus an expres@@ sion not only of G@@ od@@ ’@@ s un@@ fa@@ il@@ ing jus@@ tice but , more spec@@ ially , of his great love for humans .
However , why did Jesus have to suf@@ fer and di@@ e in the p@@ ain@@ ful way that was describ@@ ed in the G@@ os@@ p@@ els ?
By sub@@ jec@@ ting himself to the ex@@ tre@@ me t@@ est and rem@@ aining faithful , Jesus ref@@ u@@ ted on@@ ce and for all the Dev@@ il@@ ’@@ s cla@@ im that humans would not remain loyal to God when under tr@@ ial .
That cla@@ im might have se@@ em@@ ed val@@ id after Satan ind@@ uc@@ ed perfect Adam to sin .
But Jesus ​ — who was Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s perfect e@@ qu@@ iv@@ al@@ ent — ​ rem@@ ained obedi@@ ent des@@ pite s@@ ev@@ ere suffering .
He thus proved that Adam too could have o@@ bey@@ ed God if he had cho@@ s@@ en to do so .
By end@@ uring under tr@@ ial , Jesus left us a mod@@ el to follow .
God re@@ war@@ d@@ ed his S@@ on@@ ’@@ s perfect obedi@@ ence , gr@@ an@@ ting Jesus immor@@ t@@ al life in heaven .
Jesus indic@@ ated what we need to do when he said : “ This means everlasting life , their coming to know you , the only true God , and the one whom you sent , Jesus Christ . ” ​ — John 17 : 3 .

This has done wond@@ ers for her faith in God and in the Bible . ”
The first article shows how our faith can gro@@ w and remain strong .
Let me expl@@ ain what led to that con@@ vers@@ ation .
I W@@ A@@ S born in W@@ ic@@ h@@ it@@ a , K@@ ans@@ as , U@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ A . , on D@@ ec@@ ember 10 , 19@@ 36 , the ol@@ d@@ est of four children .
Then a sol@@ di@@ er wal@@ ked by , and the do@@ c@@ t@@ or y@@ el@@ led , “ Do something about this y@@ el@@ low c@@ ow@@ ard ! ”
The sol@@ di@@ er could see that the man was dr@@ un@@ k , so he told him , “ G@@ o home and s@@ ob@@ er up ! ”
He ow@@ ned two bar@@ b@@ er@@ sho@@ ps in W@@ ic@@ h@@ it@@ a , and the do@@ c@@ t@@ or was one of his c@@ li@@ ents !
With my parents , going to a conv@@ ention in W@@ ic@@ h@@ it@@ a in the 19@@ 40 ’ s
With Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s blessing and their ze@@ al@@ ous work , a congregation was started .
The brother also s@@ old my c@@ ar for $ 25 .
We were as@@ sig@@ ned to special pioneer in W@@ al@@ n@@ ut R@@ id@@ ge , Ar@@ k@@ ans@@ as .
Then in 19@@ 6@@ 2 , we were thr@@ ill@@ ed to receive an inv@@ it@@ ation to the 3@@ 7@@ th cl@@ ass of G@@ il@@ ead .
In the ministry in N@@ a@@ i@@ ro@@ b@@ i with Mary and Ch@@ r@@ is Kan@@ a@@ iya
S@@ o@@ on after , our first daugh@@ ter , K@@ imb@@ erly , was born , and 17 mon@@ ths later , we had S@@ te@@ ph@@ any .
We would also go c@@ am@@ p@@ ing with them and would have very enjoy@@ able con@@ vers@@ ations around the c@@ am@@ p@@ fir@@ e .
We arrang@@ ed to have some who were in the full - time ministry stay in our home .
They were sho@@ c@@ ked and started to cr@@ y and said that they wanted to study .
With the help and direction of G@@ od@@ ’@@ s organization , we did our best to ra@@ ise them to love Jehovah .
On a later tri@@ p , K@@ imb@@ erly m@@ et one of his wor@@ k@@ m@@ ates , B@@ ri@@ an L@@ le@@ wel@@ ly@@ n .
So they did stay free until they were at le@@ ast 23 .
At the same time , B@@ ri@@ an and K@@ imb@@ erly were inv@@ ited to work at L@@ ond@@ on Bethel and later were trans@@ fer@@ red to M@@ al@@ aw@@ i Bethel .
The day after we left for the Watchtower E@@ duc@@ ati@@ onal C@@ en@@ ter in P@@ at@@ ter@@ son , L@@ inda called to tell us that M@@ other had died .
N@@ ex@@ t , we taught the course in Zim@@ bab@@ we and then in Z@@ amb@@ ia .
In 200@@ 6 , B@@ ri@@ an and K@@ imb@@ erly moved next do@@ or to us to ra@@ ise their two daugh@@ ters , M@@ ac@@ k@@ enz@@ i@@ e and El@@ iz@@ ab@@ e@@ th .
Paul and S@@ te@@ ph@@ any are still in M@@ al@@ aw@@ i , where Paul serv@@ es on the Br@@ anch Com@@ m@@ it@@ te@@ e .
Why might we need to ad@@ just our view of str@@ ang@@ ers ?

As a result , I too dec@@ ided that I wanted to ded@@ ic@@ ate my life to Jehovah .
My mother said that I should first speak to the serv@@ ant to the b@@ re@@ th@@ ren ( now called a circ@@ uit overse@@ er ) .

How , though , does the hope of a re@@ ward benefit us ?
Jesus showed that his disciples would be re@@ war@@ d@@ ed for their sacrif@@ ices ( See paragr@@ aph 5 )
The apostle Peter on@@ ce asked Jesus : “ We have left all things and follow@@ ed you ; what , then , will there be for us ? ”
In the S@@ er@@ m@@ on on the M@@ ount , Jesus said : “ Re@@ jo@@ ice and be over@@ j@@ oy@@ ed , since your re@@ ward is great in the heaven@@ s , for in that way they pers@@ ecu@@ ted the proph@@ e@@ ts pri@@ or to you . ”

Wh@@ en@@ ever I make personal sacrif@@ ices for him , he gives me back a h@@ und@@ re@@ d@@ fol@@ d in blessings . ”
For my own encourag@@ ement , I keep a no@@ t@@ eb@@ o@@ ok with sc@@ ript@@ ures and though@@ ts from our pub@@ lic@@ ations that I can con@@ s@@ ult from time to time .
I c@@ all it ‘ My S@@ ur@@ v@@ iv@@ al No@@ t@@ eb@@ o@@ ok . ’

3 , 4 . ( a ) How can parents set a good example for their children ?
( b ) What should parents not exp@@ ect of their children ?
When your children see you “ se@@ ek@@ ing first the Kingdom , ” they learn to dep@@ end on Jehovah for their d@@ a@@ ily needs .
N@@ ever get so bus@@ y that you do not have time for your children .
How may your children benefit from lear@@ ning your language ?
Par@@ ents , if that describ@@ es your children , can you learn at le@@ ast some of the loc@@ al language ?
A child who comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ates best in another sp@@ ok@@ en language des@@ er@@ ves the same concer@@ n , would you not ag@@ ree ?
If that is your situation , you can still help your children to come to know and love Jehovah .
“ But when we saw her stud@@ ying , pray@@ ing , and doing her best to conduct family worship every w@@ ee@@ k , we underst@@ ood that g@@ et@@ ting to know Jehovah was very important . ”
How can parents help children who may need to study in two langu@@ ages ?
( a ) Who must dec@@ ide which language congregation to att@@ end ?
That may not be the case when children do not fully understand the language .
( Read 1 Corinthians 14 : 9 , 11 . )
The answer was not what we person@@ ally found conv@@ en@@ ient .
But when we saw that they were g@@ et@@ ting little benefit from the meetings in our language , we dec@@ ided to move to the loc@@ al - language congregation .
T@@ og@@ ether , we reg@@ ularly att@@ ended meetings and shar@@ ed in the ministry .
We also inv@@ ited loc@@ al friends to jo@@ in us for me@@ als and exc@@ ur@@ sions .
All of this helped our children to get to know the brothers and to get to know Jehovah , not only as their God but also as their Father and F@@ ri@@ end .
We consid@@ ered this to be much more important than their m@@ as@@ ter@@ ing our language . ”
Sam@@ uel ad@@ ds : “ To keep ourselves spiritually strong , my wife and I also att@@ ended meetings in our language .
L@@ ife was very bus@@ y , and we were ti@@ red .
But we than@@ k Jehovah for blessing our ef@@ forts and sacrif@@ ices .
Our three children are all serving Jehovah in the full - time ministry . ”
“ I knew the basi@@ c@@ s of my parents ’ language , but the language sp@@ ok@@ en at the meetings was over my head , ” rec@@ all@@ s K@@ ris@@ t@@ ina .
“ When I was 12 , I att@@ ended a conv@@ ention in my school language .
For the first time , I underst@@ ood that what I was hear@@ ing was the truth !
A@@ no@@ ther tur@@ ning point came when I began to pray in my school language .
I could speak to Jehovah from my heart ! ”
Y@@ oung people , do you think that you would pre@@ fer being part of a loc@@ al - language congregation ?
“ When my sib@@ l@@ ings and I got into our te@@ ens , we wanted to s@@ w@@ it@@ ch to the loc@@ al - language congregation , ” says N@@ ad@@ ia , who now serv@@ es at Bethel .
“ Now we@@ ’@@ re grat@@ eful that our parents wor@@ ked hard to teach us their language and kept us in the fore@@ ign - language congregation .
It has en@@ ric@@ hed our lives and b@@ ro@@ ad@@ ened our opport@@ un@@ ities to help others get to know Jehovah . ”
( b ) How can parents get help in teaching their children the truth ?
( Read Proverbs 1 : 8 ; 31 : 10 , 27 , 28 . )
Still , parents who do not know the loc@@ al language may need help to reach their ch@@ ild@@ r@@ en@@ ’@@ s heart .
B@@ o@@ th children and parents benefit from associ@@ ation with the congregation ( See paragr@@ aph@@ s 18 , 19 )
( b ) What must parents continue to do ?
“ When they helped me with stud@@ ent talk assign@@ ments for the meeting , I always learned more .
And I enjoy@@ ed the le@@ is@@ ure activ@@ ities we shar@@ ed in as a group . ”
Par@@ ents , pray to Jehovah for help , and try your best .

At that time , she gave me a pi@@ ec@@ e of c@@ and@@ y and asked if we could be friends .
When she wanted to get baptized , her parents told her , “ Bec@@ ome one of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , and you will have to le@@ ave our home ! ”
She continu@@ ed her study and later got baptized .
When we got married in 19@@ 60 , her parents did not come to our w@@ ed@@ ding .

How can we keep our love for Jehovah strong ?
How can we deep@@ en our love for Bible truth ?
Why is it important to have affec@@ tion for our brothers ?
What may have c@@ a@@ used the love of some Christians to gro@@ w c@@ old ?
Pe@@ ople today have less and less love for God .

S@@ how love for Jehovah ( See paragr@@ aph 10 )
( Read Psalm 1@@ 19 : 9@@ 7 - 1@@ 00 . )
S@@ how love for Bible truth ( See paragr@@ aph 14 )
On his last night on earth , Jesus said to his disciples : “ I am giving you a new comm@@ and@@ ment , that you love one another ; just as I have loved you , you also love one another .
By this all will know that you are my disciples ​ — if you have love among y@@ ourselves . ” ​ — John 13 : 34 , 35 .
The apostle John wrote : “ The one who does not love his brother , whom he has seen , cannot love God , whom he has not seen . ”
S@@ how love for the brothers and sisters ( See paragr@@ aph 17 )
What are some ways in which we can show love ?
Read 1 Th@@ ess@@ alon@@ ians 4 : 9 , 10 .
“ Sim@@ on son of John , do you love me more than these ? ” ​ — J@@ O@@ H@@ N 21 : 15 .
Then he said to them : “ ‘ C@@ ast the ne@@ t on the right side of the bo@@ at and you will find some . ’
So they c@@ ast it , but they were not able to ha@@ ul it in because of the lar@@ ge number of f@@ ish . ” ​ — John 21 : 1 - 6 .
( b ) What valu@@ able less@@ on did a brother in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and learn about his work ?
As a result , it left me al@@ most no time for spiritual matters .

I pray@@ ed to Jehovah , as@@ king him to help me to cop@@ e and to reach my go@@ al of having more time for spiritual activ@@ ities .
I got better ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ ted with my c@@ ust@@ om@@ ers ’ t@@ ast@@ es and became more s@@ kill@@ ful in making ice cre@@ am .
S@@ o@@ on , I was sel@@ ling all my ice cre@@ am every day .
Ac@@ t@@ ually , I was better - off fin@@ anc@@ ially than when I wor@@ ked with comp@@ ut@@ ers .
It has made me happ@@ i@@ er because I do not have the str@@ ess and wor@@ ry that I had with my form@@ er jo@@ b .
And most important , I now feel clo@@ s@@ er to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Matthew 5 : 3 , 6 .
After his bapt@@ ism , he said : “ The only re@@ gre@@ t I have is that I lo@@ st so much time before I real@@ ized that serving Jehovah br@@ ings far more happ@@ iness than pur@@ su@@ ing the ent@@ er@@ t@@ ain@@ ment of@@ fered by this world . ”

( a ) Why did the apostle Paul descr@@ ibe our ministry as a “ t@@ reas@@ ure in ear@@ then v@@ es@@ sel@@ s ” ?
( Read Romans 1 : 14 , 15 ; 2 Timothy 4 : 2 . )
Some of them serve as B@@ eth@@ el@@ ites , pione@@ ers , and elders .

( Read Proverbs 2 : 4 - 7 . )
Consider the experience of a brother nam@@ ed Peter .
To t@@ est Peter , the r@@ ab@@ b@@ i asked , “ So , my bo@@ y , what language was the book of Daniel written in ? ”
When I went home and ch@@ ec@@ ked the Watchtower and A@@ w@@ ake !

As you do this , you will bu@@ ild up “ t@@ reas@@ ure in the heaven@@ s , where no th@@ i@@ ef g@@ e@@ ts near and no mo@@ th con@@ s@@ um@@ es .
For where your t@@ reas@@ ure is , there your hearts will be also . ” ​ — Luke 12 : 33 , 34 .

“ I began se@@ e@@ ing my own person@@ ality fl@@ aw@@ s , and I was very dis@@ appointed in my@@ self .

If you are g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing , you too can find so@@ oth@@ ing comfort from such sc@@ ript@@ ures as the following :
( Read 1 Th@@ ess@@ alon@@ ians 5 : 11 . )
What do we need to remember about g@@ ri@@ ef ?
Even when someone does expres@@ s how he feel@@ s , it is not always eas@@ y for others to understand what he is tr@@ ying to say .
At that m@@ om@@ ent , I d@@ on@@ ’@@ t feel qu@@ ite so al@@ one in my g@@ ri@@ ef . ”
“ R@@ ec@@ e@@ iving a shor@@ t encourag@@ ing message or an inv@@ it@@ ation to sp@@ end time with a fellow Christian helps me more than I can say , ” says J@@ un@@ ia .

What pl@@ ans can lead to a happy future for you ?
What could a life in the pioneer service lead to ?
Y@@ O@@ U young ones will pro@@ bab@@ ly ag@@ ree that before star@@ ting a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , it is wise to pl@@ an where you will go .
L@@ ife is like a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , and the time to pl@@ an where you want to go is when you are young .
How do you know that Jehovah wants you to pl@@ an for a happy future ?
Your Creator is “ the God of love , ” “ the happy God , ” who made humans “ in his im@@ age . ”
You will be happy when you imitate our loving God .
Jesus Christ set the perfect example for you young ones .
Jesus also d@@ re@@ w close to Jehovah by stud@@ ying the Scriptures .
“ P@@ l@@ ans fa@@ il when there is no con@@ s@@ ul@@ t@@ ation , but there is ac@@ compl@@ ish@@ ment through many adv@@ is@@ ers . ”
As with any car@@ e@@ er , you need time to become s@@ kill@@ ed .
At first , I co@@ ul@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t star@@ t any Bible stud@@ ies , but later I moved to another terr@@ it@@ ory , and with@@ in a mon@@ th I started s@@ ever@@ al stud@@ ies .
One stud@@ ent began coming to the Kingdom H@@ all .
For example , J@@ ac@@ o@@ b , from N@@ or@@ th Am@@ er@@ ic@@ a , wr@@ ites : “ When I was s@@ even , many of my cl@@ ass@@ m@@ ates were V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese .
I wanted to tell them about Jehovah , so after a while I made pl@@ ans to learn their language .
For the most part , I learned by com@@ par@@ ing the Eng@@ lis@@ h and V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese ed@@ itions of The Watchtower .
I also made friends in a ne@@ ar@@ by V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese - language congregation .
When I was 18 , I started pione@@ ering .
L@@ ater , I att@@ ended the Bible Sc@@ hool for Sing@@ le Broth@@ ers .
This helped me with my present pioneer assign@@ ment , where I am the only elder in a V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese - language group .
Many V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese people are amaz@@ ed that I have learned their language .
They inv@@ ite me in , and often I can study the Bible with them .
Some have prog@@ res@@ sed to bapt@@ ism . ” ​ — Com@@ p@@ are Acts 2 : 7 , 8 .
I enjoy encourag@@ ing the young brothers in our congregation and se@@ e@@ ing their spiritual prog@@ ress .
After I att@@ ended the Bible Sc@@ hool for Sing@@ le Broth@@ ers , I received a new pioneer assign@@ ment .
I@@ t@@ ’@@ s true that I have never found anyone in the terr@@ it@@ ory who prog@@ res@@ sed to bapt@@ ism , but others have .
How may pioneer service lead to other opport@@ un@@ ities ?
A brother nam@@ ed K@@ ev@@ in says : “ E@@ ver since I was a little bo@@ y , I have wanted to serve Jehovah full - time som@@ ed@@ ay .
F@@ in@@ ally , I started pione@@ ering when I was 19 .
I suppor@@ ted my@@ self working part - time for a brother who was a bu@@ il@@ der .

When I heard about the con@@ struc@@ tion needs in S@@ ou@@ th Af@@ ric@@ a , I appl@@ ied and was inv@@ ited to go .
H@@ ere in Af@@ ric@@ a , I move from one Kingdom H@@ all pro@@ ject to another every few we@@ ek@@ s .
We live together , study the Bible together , and work together .
I also enjoy preaching with the loc@@ al brothers each w@@ ee@@ k .
The pl@@ ans I made as a bo@@ y have made me happy in ways I did not for@@ es@@ e@@ e . ”
Bethel service is a happy way of life because everything you do there is for Jehovah .
After a year and a half , I was inv@@ ited to Bethel , where I learned to op@@ er@@ ate pr@@ int@@ ing pres@@ ses and later to do comp@@ u@@ ter pro@@ gr@@ am@@ m@@ ing .
At Bethel , I enjoy hear@@ ing fir@@ s@@ th@@ and about the prog@@ ress of the disci@@ ple - making activ@@ ity world@@ wide .
I love serving h@@ ere because what we do helps people to draw close to Jehovah . ”
You can be sure that Jehovah wants you to “ get a fir@@ m hold ” on a happy future .

What can we learn from the example of the prophet M@@ ic@@ ah ?
( Read M@@ ic@@ ah 7 : 1 - 3 . )
If we have faith like that of M@@ ic@@ ah , we will be willing to wa@@ it for Jehovah .
So we “ end@@ ure fully with pati@@ ence and joy . ”
Abraham had to wa@@ it many years before his gr@@ and@@ sons E@@ sa@@ u and J@@ ac@@ o@@ b were born ( See paragr@@ aph@@ s 9 , 10 )

( Read 2 Peter 3 : 9 . )
What will help us to be willing to wa@@ it pati@@ ently ?
What less@@ ons do we learn from what happ@@ ened to the apostle Paul in Philipp@@ i ?
( Read Acts 16 : 8 - 10 . )
S@@ o@@ on after he arr@@ ived in M@@ ac@@ ed@@ on@@ ia , he ended up in pris@@ on !
Why did Jehovah allow this to happ@@ en to Paul ?
B@@ o@@ th he and S@@ il@@ as started “ pray@@ ing and pra@@ is@@ ing God with s@@ ong . ”
4 , 5 . ( a ) How could our situation be similar to that of Paul ?
( b ) How did P@@ a@@ ul@@ ’@@ s situation change un@@ expec@@ t@@ ed@@ ly ?
What will we now discus@@ s and re@@ view together ?
( Read 1 Peter 5 : 6 , 7 . )
We need to act in har@@ mon@@ y with our prayers .
Som@@ e@@ times he sur@@ pris@@ es us by doing the un@@ expec@@ ted .
Jehovah sent an ang@@ el to destro@@ y 1@@ 8@@ 5@@ ,000 of S@@ en@@ n@@ ach@@ er@@ ib@@ ’@@ s sol@@ di@@ ers in one night .
( a ) What less@@ on do we learn from what happ@@ ened to Joseph ?
No doubt Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s actions exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ed all of Jos@@ eph@@ ’@@ s expec@@ t@@ ations .
Th@@ ink , too , about Jos@@ eph@@ ’@@ s great - gr@@ and@@ mother S@@ ar@@ ah .
( Read Isaiah 43 : 10 - 13 . )
We know that Jehovah car@@ es for us and wants us to succ@@ eed .
How can we str@@ i@@ p off and keep off the old person@@ ality ?
By 19@@ 39 there were 6@@ ,000 of them in the [ con@@ c@@ en@@ tr@@ ation c@@ am@@ ps ] . ”

What helped S@@ te@@ ph@@ en to put away anger and ab@@ usi@@ ve spe@@ ec@@ h ?
He says : “ Our family life im@@ proved dr@@ am@@ at@@ ic@@ ally .
Today , S@@ te@@ ph@@ en serv@@ es as a minis@@ ter@@ ial serv@@ ant , and his wife has been a reg@@ ular pioneer for s@@ ever@@ al years .
Bible t@@ ex@@ ts that encourag@@ ed me were Isaiah 5@@ 5 : 7 , which says : ‘ Let the wicked man le@@ ave his way , ’ and 1 Corinthians 6 : 11 , which says about those who had ab@@ and@@ oned sin@@ ful ways : ‘ And yet that is what some of you were . ’

( See op@@ ening p@@ ict@@ ure . ) ( b ) What have been the res@@ ul@@ ts ?
Then he att@@ ended a meeting of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
When we showed them sc@@ ript@@ ures from their P@@ or@@ t@@ ug@@ u@@ ese Bible , such as Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 or Psalm 37 : 10 , 11 , 29 , they p@@ a@@ id attention and some@@ times even sh@@ ed t@@ ears . ”
What example did Jesus set in show@@ ing m@@ ild@@ ness and pati@@ ence ?
Then he add@@ ed : “ If you continue show@@ ing fav@@ or@@ it@@ ism , you are comm@@ it@@ ting sin . ”
Why is it important that we clo@@ the ourselves with love ?
Lo@@ ve is also “ pati@@ ent and kind ” and “ does not get p@@ uf@@ f@@ ed up . ”
Paul said that without love , he was “ nothing . ”
The love is in this respect , not that we have loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son as a pro@@ p@@ iti@@ at@@ ory sacrifice for our sins . ”
Jesus said : “ No one has love greater than this , that someone should sur@@ r@@ end@@ er his life in be@@ half of his friends . ”
Let us consider how we can do so .
John wrote : “ L@@ it@@ tle children , we should love , not in word or with the t@@ ong@@ ue , but in de@@ ed and truth . ”
But then I asked my@@ self , ‘ How can I imitate Jesus in de@@ al@@ ing with this person ? ’
After reflec@@ ting on what Jesus would have done , I dec@@ ided to let the matter go and not make an is@@ sue of it .
L@@ ater , I learned that my c@@ ow@@ or@@ k@@ er had been cop@@ ing with a serious heal@@ th pro@@ b@@ le@@ m and was under a lo@@ t of str@@ ess .
I concl@@ ud@@ ed that she pro@@ bab@@ ly did not really mean what she wrote .
R@@ ef@@ lec@@ ting on Jesus ’ example of show@@ ing love even when prov@@ ok@@ ed helped me to show similar love to my c@@ ow@@ or@@ k@@ er . ”
By le@@ av@@ ing heaven , “ he emp@@ ti@@ ed himself ” in our be@@ half , even “ to the point of death . ”
P@@ E@@ AC@@ E : “ P@@ ut@@ ting up with one another in love ” al@@ lo@@ ws us to enjoy “ the un@@ iting b@@ ond of peace . ”
Would you not ag@@ ree that such a pe@@ ac@@ eful spirit is truly un@@ i@@ qu@@ e in t@@ od@@ ay@@ ’@@ s div@@ ided world ?
Paul wrote : “ Lo@@ ve bu@@ il@@ ds up . ”
The following day , they had out@@ gro@@ w@@ n the v@@ en@@ ue . ”
B@@ el@@ ow the p@@ ict@@ ure was the cap@@ tion : “ In@@ v@@ asi@@ on of the st@@ re@@ e@@ ts . ”

( a ) Why did Jehovah s@@ end angels to S@@ od@@ om ?
( Read Ex@@ od@@ us 22 : 26 , 27 . )
We read : “ Jehovah the God of their fo@@ ref@@ ath@@ ers kept war@@ ning them by means of his mess@@ eng@@ ers , war@@ ning them again and again , because he felt comp@@ as@@ sion for his people and for his d@@ wel@@ ling place . ”
“ He started to teach them many things . ”

How can Psalm 37 : 25 and Hebrews 13 : 5 help parents ?
( Read Psalm 37 : 25 ; Hebrews 13 : 5 . )
A brother who has two children wrote : “ Many parents exp@@ end much ef@@ fort and res@@ our@@ c@@ es helping their children reach go@@ als in such ar@@ e@@ as as sp@@ or@@ ts , rec@@ re@@ ation , and ed@@ uc@@ ation .
It makes so much more sense to exp@@ end ef@@ fort and res@@ our@@ c@@ es in helping our children reach go@@ als that will help them to maintain a good stand@@ ing with Jehovah .
It has been a great s@@ our@@ ce of satis@@ fac@@ tion not only to see our children reach spiritual go@@ als but to share the j@@ our@@ ne@@ y with them . ”
G@@ ive examples of courage in the Christian congregation .
( a ) How can baptized brothers be cour@@ ag@@ e@@ ous ?
( Read Philipp@@ ians 2 : 13 ; 4 : 13 . )
We ur@@ ge all baptized brothers to be cour@@ ag@@ e@@ ous and work hard for the congregation !
Th@@ er@@ efore , “ be cour@@ ag@@ e@@ ous . . . and go to work . ”

Those ver@@ ses lik@@ en G@@ od@@ ’@@ s Word to a mir@@ ro@@ r in which we can see ourselves the way Jehovah se@@ es us .
I began to w@@ on@@ der if what I saw in my@@ self was different from what Jehovah saw .
At first , I res@@ is@@ ted this new id@@ ea .
I still felt that loving me was too much to exp@@ ect of Jehovah .
“ A few days later , I read a sc@@ ript@@ ure that chang@@ ed my life .
I felt as if Jehovah were spe@@ aking to me , saying : ‘ C@@ ome on , V@@ ick@@ y , let@@ ’@@ s set matters str@@ a@@ ight between us .

“ I was un@@ able to s@@ le@@ ep that night .
I still doub@@ ted that Jehovah could love me , but I began thinking about Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice .
All of a s@@ ud@@ den , it d@@ aw@@ ned on me that Jehovah had been pati@@ ent with me for so long , show@@ ing me that he loved me in so many ways .
Yet , I was , in ef@@ fect , saying to him : ‘ Your love is not great en@@ ough to reach me .
Your S@@ on@@ ’@@ s sacrifice is not en@@ ough to c@@ over me . ’
It was as if I had been th@@ row@@ ing the ransom back at Jehovah .
But now , at last , by medit@@ ating on this gift of the ransom , I began to feel loved by Jehovah . ”

For if we have faith that Jesus died and ro@@ se again , so too God will bring with him those who have f@@ all@@ en as@@ le@@ ep in death . . .
We the living who sur@@ v@@ ive to the pres@@ ence of the Lord will in no way prec@@ ed@@ e those who have f@@ all@@ en as@@ le@@ ep in death ; because the Lord himself will des@@ c@@ end from heaven with a comm@@ anding c@@ all , . . . and those who are dead in un@@ ion with Christ will r@@ ise first .

We are the only Witnesses they are ex@@ pos@@ ed to .
So the way we act can determin@@ e how they will resp@@ ond .
What if we are sh@@ y or tim@@ id or have a hard time spe@@ aking up about our faith , or what if we cr@@ ing@@ e when we do speak up ?
Then they may look at us as if we ar@@ en@@ ’@@ t pr@@ ou@@ d of who we are .
They may even resp@@ ond un@@ kind@@ ly because of our l@@ ack of confid@@ ence .
However , if we talk with e@@ ase and ass@@ ur@@ ance about what we believe , making it a nor@@ m@@ al part of con@@ vers@@ ation , it@@ ’@@ s more likely that they will respect us . ”

How can we avoid be@@ coming lov@@ ers of money ?
It means that they do not love God at all . ”
How can we avoid be@@ coming lov@@ ers of pleas@@ ures ?
( Read 2 Timothy 3 : 1 - 5 , 13 . )
We also know that love “ does not b@@ ra@@ g , does not get p@@ uf@@ f@@ ed up . ”

( Read Psalm 11 : 5 ; 26 : 4 . )
So ask yourself , ‘ Do I know Jehovah as well as Noah , Daniel , and Job did ? ’
No@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s great - gr@@ and@@ father E@@ no@@ ch also “ kept wal@@ king with the true God . ”
Jesus said : “ Abraham your father re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed great@@ ly at the pro@@ sp@@ ect of se@@ e@@ ing my day . ”

But lear@@ ning the truth moved me to make the needed ef@@ fort to be a spiritual person .
M@@ aking chang@@ es was not eas@@ y , but I became happ@@ i@@ er and found real purpose in life . ”
So being like Jesus makes us more like Jehovah .
They said : “ We are w@@ itnesses of all the things he did . ”
How will having the mind of Christ affect your d@@ a@@ ily life ?
He says : “ I never did anything wrong , but I was just going through the mo@@ tions .
I look@@ ed spiritually strong , being at all the meetings and serving as an au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary pioneer a few times a year .
He says : “ It was as if I knew nothing .
I thought to my@@ self , ‘ If I am going to be my w@@ if@@ e@@ ’@@ s spiritual head , I have to do something . ’ ”

Why do we not pres@@ sure anyone to get baptized ?
What questions will we consider in the next article ?
If you are a par@@ ent , you may have asked yourself : ‘ Is my child really ready to get baptized ?
The first question is , “ On the basi@@ s of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ , have you rep@@ ented of your sins and ded@@ ic@@ ated yourself to Jehovah to do his will ? ”
How can we be ho@@ sp@@ it@@ able at our Christian meetings ?
( Read 3 John 5 - 8 . )
He wr@@ ites : “ I h@@ es@@ it@@ ated in@@ iti@@ ally because we were new@@ ly married and living in a small house .
But having stud@@ ents stay with us was truly a j@@ oy@@ ous experience .
As new@@ ly@@ w@@ ed@@ s , we were able to see how happy a couple can be when they serve Jehovah and pur@@ sue spiritual go@@ als together . ”
Why may those who are new to your congregation need ho@@ sp@@ it@@ ality ?
( Read Luke 10 : 41 , 42 . )
One ev@@ ening my wife was par@@ tic@@ ularly ho@@ m@@ es@@ ic@@ k , and my ef@@ forts to help were not working .
Then , about 7 : 30 p@@ .@@ m . , we heard a kno@@ c@@ k on the do@@ or .
There st@@ ood a Bible stud@@ ent who brought us three or@@ ang@@ es .
She had come to wel@@ come the new mis@@ sion@@ ar@@ ies .

If you feel an@@ x@@ ious about having gu@@ ests , you are not al@@ one .
A@@ n elder in Br@@ it@@ ain ad@@ m@@ its : “ There can be a me@@ as@@ ure of n@@ er@@ v@@ ousness in pre@@ par@@ ing for gu@@ ests .

A@@ no@@ ther elder wr@@ ites : “ H@@ av@@ ing friends from the congregation to my home helps me to understand them better and gives me time to get to know them , especially how they came into the truth . ”
The wife of one of the instruc@@ tor@@ s really put me at e@@ ase .
She said that when she and her husband are serving in the travel@@ ing work , their best we@@ ek@@ s are those sp@@ ent st@@ aying with a spiritual person who may not have much mater@@ ially but who has the same foc@@ us as they have ​ — serving Jehovah and k@@ eep@@ ing life sim@@ ple .
This rem@@ ind@@ ed me of what my m@@ u@@ m used to say to us as children : ‘ Be@@ t@@ ter a dis@@ h of v@@ eg@@ et@@ ab@@ les where ther@@ e@@ ’@@ s love . ’ ”

The elder rec@@ all@@ ed : “ G@@ raha@@ m had a pro@@ b@@ le@@ m with pr@@ ide .
He was cr@@ it@@ ical of the elders who had been involved in his dis@@ fel@@ low@@ shipp@@ ing .
So for the next few stud@@ ies , we discus@@ sed sc@@ ript@@ ures on pr@@ ide and its ef@@ fec@@ ts .
G@@ raha@@ m began to see himself c@@ learly in the mir@@ ro@@ r of G@@ od@@ ’@@ s Word , and he did not like what he saw !
After ac@@ knowled@@ g@@ ing that he had been bl@@ ind@@ ed by a ‘ r@@ after ’ of pr@@ ide and that his cr@@ it@@ ical attitude was his pro@@ b@@ le@@ m , he began to change qu@@ ick@@ ly for the better .
He started to att@@ end Christian meetings reg@@ ularly , to study G@@ od@@ ’@@ s Word ear@@ nes@@ tly , and to make d@@ a@@ ily prayer a hab@@ it .
The apostle Peter wrote : “ S@@ he@@ pher@@ d the f@@ loc@@ k of God under your care , serving as overse@@ ers , not under comp@@ ul@@ sion , but will@@ ingly before God ; not for love of dis@@ hon@@ est gain , but e@@ ag@@ erly ; not l@@ or@@ ding it over those who are G@@ od@@ ’@@ s in@@ her@@ it@@ ance , but be@@ coming examples to the f@@ loc@@ k . ”
How can parents ra@@ ise their children in the discipl@@ ine of Jehovah ?

( b ) How did one family benefit from the parents ’ obedi@@ ence to Jehovah ?
Some years later , the daugh@@ ter was re@@ inst@@ ated .
( b ) How can we make the elders ’ work more pleas@@ ant for them ?
They did not b@@ er@@ ate me or cr@@ it@@ ic@@ ize me , but they encourag@@ ed me and streng@@ th@@ ened me .
After every congregation meeting , no matter how bus@@ y they were , at le@@ ast one of them would ask how I was .
Because of my past , I found it difficult to feel wor@@ thy of G@@ od@@ ’@@ s love .
Tim@@ e and time again , however , Jehovah has used the congregation and the elders to con@@ fir@@ m his love for me .
I pray that I will never let him go . ”
If you turn to doing good , will you not be res@@ tor@@ ed to fav@@ or ?
But if you do not turn to doing good , sin is cr@@ ou@@ ch@@ ing at the do@@ or , and its cr@@ av@@ ing is to dom@@ in@@ ate you ; but will you get the m@@ as@@ ter@@ y over it ? ”
So let us “ listen to discipl@@ ine and become wise . ”

Like that p@@ il@@ o@@ t , Adam and Eve wanted to do things their own way .
He said : “ If you remain in my word , you are really my disciples , and you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free . ”
Why can the freedom that Jesus promised make us “ truly free ” ?

I was born in a one - ro@@ om lo@@ g c@@ ab@@ in in a very small t@@ own called L@@ ib@@ er@@ ty , Ind@@ i@@ ana , U@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ A .
L@@ ater , my mother gave b@@ ir@@ th to my two you@@ ng@@ er brothers and my you@@ ng@@ er sister .
D@@ UR@@ ING my school years , not much chang@@ ed .
The t@@ own of L@@ ib@@ er@@ ty was sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ed by small f@@ ar@@ m@@ s , and the basi@@ c c@@ ro@@ p was cor@@ n .
She took us to the B@@ apt@@ ist ch@@ ur@@ ch every S@@ und@@ ay .
They wanted me to make the mil@@ it@@ ary my car@@ e@@ er .
This time , however , they inv@@ ited me to come to a C@@ ong@@ reg@@ ation B@@ o@@ ok St@@ ud@@ y , a small meeting for Bible study and discus@@ sion that was hel@@ d in their home .
I told them I would think about it .
I co@@ ul@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t believe how much they knew about the Bible !
Y@@ ears before , when I asked my mother about Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , she sim@@ ply said , “ O@@ h , they worship some old man nam@@ ed Jehovah . ”
But I now felt that my eyes were being op@@ ened !
I started pione@@ ering the next year , in 195@@ 8 .
G@@ l@@ or@@ ia was a j@@ e@@ we@@ l then , and she is a j@@ e@@ we@@ l today .
G@@ l@@ or@@ ia and I got married in F@@ eb@@ r@@ u@@ ary of 195@@ 9 .
A de@@ ar brother , Sim@@ on K@@ r@@ ak@@ er , inter@@ view@@ ed us .
He told us that Bethel was not accep@@ ting married cou@@ ples at that time .
M@@ ost of our j@@ ob@@ s p@@ a@@ id three d@@ ol@@ lar@@ s a day .
E@@ ach w@@ ee@@ k , G@@ l@@ or@@ ia did ir@@ on@@ ing for one family .
I remember one time when we st@@ op@@ p@@ ed at a g@@ as st@@ ation .
On the other hand , we had wond@@ erful times with the brothers , and we loved our ministry !
M@@ e@@ an@@ while , I started a study with the cou@@ ple@@ ’@@ s daugh@@ ter and her husband .
M@@ other and daugh@@ ter both dec@@ ided to serve Jehovah and got baptized .
We had de@@ ar friends in the wh@@ ite congregation .
The K@@ u K@@ l@@ u@@ x K@@ l@@ an ( K@@ K@@ K ) , an organization that prom@@ ot@@ es r@@ ac@@ ism and viol@@ ence , was very ac@@ tive then .
In 19@@ 6@@ 2 , I was inv@@ ited to att@@ end the Kingdom M@@ in@@ is@@ try Sc@@ hool at S@@ ou@@ th L@@ ans@@ ing , New Y@@ or@@ k .
However , a tel@@ eph@@ one comp@@ any in P@@ ine B@@ l@@ uf@@ f had inter@@ view@@ ed me for a jo@@ b .
If they h@@ ir@@ ed me , I would be the first bl@@ ack man to work for that comp@@ any .
I had no money to trav@@ el to New Y@@ or@@ k .
She said , “ G@@ o to school and learn as much as you can , and come back and teach us ! ”
I am so gl@@ ad that I did not take that jo@@ b !
H@@ ere is how G@@ l@@ or@@ ia rem@@ embers our time in P@@ ine B@@ l@@ uf@@ f : “ I fel@@ l in love with the terr@@ it@@ ory !
So we would go in the house - to - house work in the mor@@ ning and then conduct Bible stud@@ ies the res@@ t of the day , some@@ times until 11 o@@ ’@@ clo@@ c@@ k at night .
While we were pione@@ ering in P@@ ine B@@ l@@ uf@@ f , we appl@@ ied to become special pione@@ ers .
Broth@@ er Le@@ on W@@ e@@ av@@ er , now the co@@ ord@@ in@@ at@@ or of the United States Br@@ anch Com@@ m@@ it@@ te@@ e , was appointed to serve as a circ@@ uit overse@@ er at the same time .

In those days , a circ@@ uit overse@@ er received little tr@@ aining .
I remember saying to G@@ l@@ or@@ ia , “ Does he really have to le@@ ave now ? ”
One time , the K@@ K@@ K hel@@ d a mar@@ ch in a t@@ own we were vis@@ iting in T@@ en@@ nes@@ see .
