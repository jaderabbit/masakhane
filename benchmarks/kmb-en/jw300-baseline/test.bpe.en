TH@@ IS MA@@ G@@ A@@ Z@@ IN@@ E , The Watchtower , hon@@ ors Jehovah God , the R@@ ul@@ er of the uni@@ verse .
It comfor@@ ts people with the good news that G@@ od@@ ’@@ s heavenly Kingdom will soon end all wic@@ ke@@ dness and trans@@ form the earth into a par@@ adise .
It prom@@ ot@@ es faith in Jesus Christ , who died so that we might gain everlasting life and who is now rul@@ ing as King of G@@ od@@ ’@@ s Kingdom .
This ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine has been published continu@@ ously since 18@@ 7@@ 9 and is n@@ on@@ pol@@ itical .
It ad@@ her@@ es to the Bible as its authority .
It is provi@@ ded as part of a worl@@ d@@ wide Bible e@@ duc@@ ation@@ al work suppor@@ ted by v@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ary d@@ on@@ ations .
To make a d@@ on@@ ation , please vis@@ it w@@ w@@ w.@@ jw.org .
Un@@ less o@@ ther@@ wise indic@@ ated , S@@ crip@@ ture qu@@ ot@@ ations are from the mo@@ der@@ n - language New World Tr@@ ans@@ l@@ ation of the H@@ ol@@ y Scriptures .
Be@@ be had been very close to her father .
The re@@ mar@@ k came from a well - meaning family friend , but Be@@ be found it more cu@@ tting than comfor@@ ting .
“ His death w@@ as@@ n@@ ’@@ t for the best , ” she kept re@@ pe@@ ating to her@@ self .
It was clear that when Be@@ be rec@@ oun@@ ted the in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent in a book years later , she was still gri@@ ev@@ ing .
As Be@@ be came to see , it can take a long time for someone to over@@ come gri@@ ef , especially when the b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed person was very close to the dec@@ eas@@ ed .
In the Bible , death is ap@@ tly describ@@ ed as “ the last ene@@ my . ”
It bre@@ a@@ ks into our lives with ir@@ res@@ ist@@ ible for@@ ce , often when we are completely un@@ pre@@ pared , and it ro@@ bs us of those we hold de@@ ar .
N@@ one of us are im@@ mu@@ ne to its r@@ av@@ ages .
So it is not sur@@ pris@@ ing if we feel at a l@@ os@@ s when it comes to co@@ p@@ ing with death and its af@@ ter@@ mat@@ h .
Perhaps you have wond@@ ered : ‘ How long does it take to get over gri@@ ef ?
How can I comfort others who have been b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed ?
Is there any hope for our loved ones who have died ? ’
Have you ever had a b@@ ri@@ ef b@@ out with il@@ l@@ ness ?
As an example , consider how the p@@ at@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch Abraham re@@ acted when his wife died .
The Bible says that “ Abraham began to m@@ our@@ n and to we@@ ep over Sarah . ”
The expres@@ sion “ began to ” su@@ gg@@ ests that it took some time for him to co@@ pe with his l@@ os@@ s .
He gri@@ ev@@ ed for “ many days , ” and his family members were un@@ able to comfort him .
S@@ ever@@ al years later , the death of Joseph still w@@ ei@@ gh@@ ed heav@@ ily on his mind . ​ — Genesis 23 : 2 ; 37 : 34 , 35 ; 42 : 36 ; 45 : 28 .
“ My husband , R@@ ob@@ ert , died on J@@ uly 9 , 200@@ 8 .
S@@ i@@ x years later the pain in my heart is still there .
I d@@ on@@ ’@@ t think I will ever get over my l@@ os@@ s of R@@ o@@ b . ” ​ — G@@ a@@ il , ag@@ ed 60 .
“ Although I have been without my de@@ ar wife for more than 18 years , I still mis@@ s her and gri@@ e@@ ve over my l@@ os@@ s .
Wh@@ en@@ ever I see something in n@@ ature that is at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive , my thoughts go to her , and I cannot help wond@@ ering how she would have enjo@@ yed see@@ ing what I am see@@ ing . ” ​ — E@@ ti@@ en@@ ne , ag@@ ed 8@@ 4 .
C@@ learly , such p@@ ain@@ ful and long - lasting feelings are only natural .
E@@ ach person gri@@ ev@@ es in his or her own way , and it would be un@@ wise to jud@@ ge the way another person resp@@ ond@@ s to tra@@ ge@@ dy .
At the same time , we may need to hold off from cond@@ em@@ ning ourselves if our re@@ action to l@@ os@@ s seem@@ s exc@@ es@@ sive .
As we note in the “ I@@ mit@@ ate Their Fa@@ ith ” article in this issue , Isa@@ a@@ c was still gri@@ ev@@ ing over the l@@ os@@ s of his mother , Sarah , three years after her death . ​ — Genesis 24 : 6@@ 7 .
For inst@@ ance , you may find that some will adv@@ ise you not to cr@@ y or show your feelings in any way .
O@@ thers may p@@ us@@ h you to do the oppos@@ ite and exp@@ ose all your feelings .
The Bible pres@@ ents a more b@@ al@@ anc@@ ed view , one that is suppor@@ ted by mo@@ der@@ n res@@ ear@@ ch .
In some cul@@ tu@@ res it is consi@@ dered un@@ man@@ ly for a m@@ ale to cr@@ y .
But is there a real need to feel as@@ ha@@ m@@ ed about she@@ d@@ ding t@@ ears , even in pub@@ li@@ c ?
M@@ ent@@ al - health ex@@ per@@ ts ac@@ knowledge that t@@ ear@@ ful@@ ness is a nor@@ ma@@ l part of gri@@ ev@@ ing .
And gri@@ ev@@ ing may , in time , help you to move on des@@ p@@ ite the en@@ or@@ m@@ ity of your l@@ os@@ s .
Su@@ pp@@ res@@ sing gri@@ ef , however , may do more har@@ m than good .
The Bible lend@@ s no support to the n@@ oti@@ on that it is wrong or un@@ man@@ ly to sh@@ ed t@@ ears of gri@@ ef .
At the death of his de@@ ar friend La@@ z@@ ar@@ us , Jesus op@@ enly w@@ ept , even though he had the power to bring the dead back to life ! ​ — John 11 : 33 - 35 .
B@@ ou@@ ts of anger are often part of gri@@ ev@@ ing , especially in c@@ as@@ es of su@@ d@@ den , un@@ exp@@ ected death .
There are many reasons why a b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed person may feel ang@@ ry , such as when thou@@ gh@@ t@@ less and un@@ f@@ ound@@ ed comm@@ ents are made by a resp@@ ected person .
“ I was only 14 years old when my father died , ” explains a S@@ ou@@ th A@@ fri@@ can man named Mi@@ ke .
“ At the fun@@ er@@ al , the A@@ ng@@ li@@ can minis@@ ter said that God needs good people and takes them early .
* This ang@@ ered me because we des@@ per@@ ately needed our father .
E@@ speci@@ ally in the case of un@@ exp@@ ected death , the b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed person may re@@ pe@@ at@@ e@@ dly think , ‘ It might not have happened if only I had done this or that . ’
If you are being pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed by such feelings of gu@@ il@@ t and anger , it is important not to b@@ ot@@ tle up these emoti@@ ons .
Rather , speak to a friend who will listen and reas@@ sure you that such ir@@ r@@ ation@@ al feelings are common to many b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed ones .
The Bible remin@@ ds us : “ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of dist@@ ress . ” ​ — Proverbs 17 : 17 .
The best F@@ ri@@ end a b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed person can have is our Creator , Jehovah God .
P@@ our out your heart to him in prayer because “ he car@@ es for you . ”
Mo@@ re@@ over , he promises that all who do so will have their thoughts and feelings so@@ o@@ th@@ ed by “ the peace of God that sur@@ pas@@ ses all understanding . ”
Also , allow God to help you he@@ al by means of his con@@ sol@@ ing Word , the Bible .
H@@ av@@ ing such thoughts to p@@ ond@@ er over may be especially help@@ ful at night when you are alone and find it hard to s@@ le@@ ep . ​ — Isaiah 5@@ 7 : 15 .
R@@ ec@@ ently , a 40 - year - old man , whom we will c@@ all J@@ ack , lost his bel@@ o@@ ved wife to c@@ anc@@ er .
“ When I pray to Jehovah , ” he explains , “ I never feel alone .
I often wa@@ ke up during the night and cannot get back to s@@ le@@ ep .
After reading and medit@@ ating on comfor@@ ting thoughts from the Scriptures and then p@@ our@@ ing out the feelings of my heart in prayer , I sense a cal@@ m@@ ness and a trans@@ cen@@ ding peace come over me , pu@@ tting my mind and heart at rest and en@@ ab@@ ling me to s@@ le@@ ep . ”
A young woman named V@@ an@@ ess@@ a lost her mother to il@@ l@@ ness .
She too has experienced the power of prayer .
“ In my most difficult times , ” she says , “ I would just c@@ all on G@@ od@@ ’@@ s name and bre@@ ak down in t@@ ears .
Jehovah listen@@ ed to my prayers and always gave me the strength I needed . ”
Some b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ement coun@@ sel@@ ors adv@@ ise those who are str@@ u@@ gg@@ ling with gri@@ ef to get involved in helping others or to v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er their time in some commun@@ ity service .
Do@@ ing so can bring joy and may e@@ ase a person@@ ’@@ s gri@@ ef .
Many b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed Christians have found that working to help others has brought them great comfort . ​ — 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 .
God feel@@ s for you in your pain . ​ — Psalm 55 : 22 ; 1 Peter 5 : 7 .
God pati@@ ently listen@@ s to the prayers of his servants . ​ — Psalm 8@@ 6 : 5 ; 1 Thessalon@@ ians 5 : 17 .
God mis@@ ses people who have died . ​ — Job 14 : 13 - 15 .
God promises to resurrec@@ t the dead . ​ — Isaiah 26 : 19 ; John 5 : 28 , 29 .
Have you ever felt hel@@ pl@@ ess when someone near to you was gri@@ ev@@ ing over the l@@ os@@ s of a loved one ?
S@@ om@@ etimes we may feel un@@ sure of what to say or do ​ — so we w@@ ind up saying and doing nothing .
But there are practic@@ al , help@@ ful things that we can do .
O@@ f@@ ten , all that is needed is your pres@@ ence along with a sim@@ ple expres@@ sion , such as “ I am so sor@@ ry . ”
In many cul@@ tu@@ res , giving the person a hu@@ g or a g@@ ent@@ le s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze of the ar@@ m is an eff@@ ective way to show you care .
If the b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed one wants to talk , listen sy@@ m@@ pa@@ the@@ tic@@ ally .
B@@ est of all , do something for the b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed family , perhaps per@@ form@@ ing a cho@@ re the gri@@ ev@@ ing one has not been able to care for , such as co@@ o@@ king a me@@ al , car@@ ing for the children , or helping with fun@@ er@@ al arrang@@ em@@ ents if that is des@@ ir@@ ed .
Such actions may speak l@@ ou@@ der than the most el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent words .
In time , you may be moved to talk about the dec@@ eas@@ ed , perhaps fo@@ cus@@ ing on some good qualities or happy experi@@ ences .
Such con@@ vers@@ ation may even bring a s@@ mil@@ e to the b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed person@@ ’@@ s face .
For example , P@@ am ​ — who lost her husband , I@@ an , si@@ x years ag@@ o — ​ says : “ People som@@ etimes tell me good things that I@@ an did that I never knew about , and that makes my heart feel good . ”
R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers repor@@ t that many b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed people receive a lot of in@@ iti@@ al help but that their needs are soon for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten as friends get bus@@ y again with their own lives .
Th@@ er@@ efore , make a point of cont@@ ac@@ ting a b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed friend on a regul@@ ar bas@@ is after the l@@ os@@ s .
* Many gri@@ ev@@ ing ones deep@@ ly appreciate this opportunity to reli@@ e@@ ve themselves of pr@@ ol@@ ong@@ ed feelings of gri@@ ef .
Consider the example of Ka@@ or@@ i , a young J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese woman who was dev@@ ast@@ ated by the l@@ os@@ s of her mother follow@@ ed by the l@@ os@@ s of her older sister 15 mon@@ ths later .
Th@@ an@@ k@@ fully , she received ong@@ o@@ ing support from loyal friends .
One named R@@ it@@ su@@ ko is much older than Ka@@ or@@ i and offered to be her close friend .
“ To be hon@@ est , ” says Ka@@ or@@ i , “ I w@@ as@@ n@@ ’@@ t happy about that .
I di@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t want anyone to take the place of my mother , and I di@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t think that anyone could .
However , because of the way M@@ ama R@@ it@@ su@@ ko tre@@ ated me , I came to feel close to her .
E@@ very we@@ ek , we went out in the ev@@ ang@@ el@@ iz@@ ing work together and went to Christian meetings together .
She inv@@ ited me to have te@@ a with her , brought me me@@ als , and wrote me let@@ ters and car@@ ds many times .
M@@ ama R@@ it@@ su@@ ko@@ ’@@ s pos@@ itive attitude had a good influence on me . ”
T@@ wel@@ ve years have pas@@ sed since Ka@@ ori@@ ’@@ s mother died , and today she and her husband are full - time ev@@ ang@@ el@@ iz@@ ers .
“ M@@ ama R@@ it@@ su@@ ko , ” Ka@@ or@@ i says , “ continu@@ es to show her concer@@ n .
When I go back home , I always vis@@ it her and enjoy her up@@ buil@@ ding associ@@ ation . ”
Ano@@ ther example of someone who benef@@ ited from ong@@ o@@ ing support is P@@ ol@@ i , one of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses in C@@ y@@ pr@@ us .
P@@ ol@@ i had a kind husband , So@@ zo@@ s , who set a good example as a Christian shepher@@ d by often inv@@ iting or@@ ph@@ ans and wi@@ do@@ ws to their home for associ@@ ation and a me@@ al .
S@@ adly , at the age of 5@@ 3 , So@@ zo@@ s died of a b@@ ra@@ in tu@@ m@@ or .
There , they began associ@@ ating with a congregation of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
“ The friends in my new congregation , ” rec@@ al@@ ls P@@ ol@@ i , “ did not know anything about our past and our difficult circumstances .
But that did not stop them from appro@@ aching us and emb@@ rac@@ ing us with their kind words and practic@@ al help .
How precious that help was , especially at that time , when my son needed his father most !
Those taking the lead in the congregation showed a great de@@ al of personal interest in Daniel .
One in par@@ tic@@ ular made sure to inclu@@ de Daniel when enjo@@ ying associ@@ ation with friends or when going out to pl@@ ay b@@ all . ”
B@@ oth mother and son are doing well today .
To be sure , there are many ways we can offer practic@@ al help and comfort to those who m@@ our@@ n .
The Bible also comfor@@ ts us by means of a thr@@ il@@ ling hope for the future .
Some have even mar@@ ked the d@@ ate of the death on their cal@@ end@@ ar as a remin@@ der to offer comfort when it may be most needed ​ — on or near the d@@ ate of the l@@ os@@ s .
You may rec@@ all that G@@ a@@ il , mentioned ear@@ lier in this ser@@ ies , doub@@ ts whether she will ever get over the death of her husband , R@@ o@@ b .
However , she is loo@@ king forward to see@@ ing him again in G@@ od@@ ’@@ s promised new world .
My feelings really go out to people who have lost someone they love but who are not a@@ w@@ are of this hope of see@@ ing their loved one again . ”
So@@ on , God will do just that ​ — for Job and coun@@ t@@ less others — ​ when this earth is trans@@ formed into a par@@ adise .
“ There is going to be a resurrection , ” the Bible con@@ fir@@ ms at Acts 24 : 15 .
“ Do not be a@@ ma@@ zed at this , ” Jesus as@@ sures us , “ for the ho@@ ur is coming in which all those in the me@@ morial to@@ mb@@ s will hear his vo@@ ice and come out . ”
He will have the pros@@ p@@ ect of reg@@ ain@@ ing “ his you@@ th@@ ful vi@@ g@@ or , ” and his flesh will forever remain “ f@@ res@@ her than in you@@ th . ”
The same will happen to all who resp@@ ond with appreci@@ ation to G@@ od@@ ’@@ s mer@@ ci@@ ful pro@@ vision of a resurrection to life on earth .
If you have su@@ ffered the l@@ os@@ s of someone de@@ ar to you , the information we have discus@@ sed may not completely take away your gri@@ ef .
But by medit@@ ating on G@@ od@@ ’@@ s promises found in the Bible , you can find real hope and the strength to keep going . ​ — 1 Thessalon@@ ians 4 : 13 .

CO@@ V@@ ER SU@@ B@@ JE@@ C@@ T | W@@ H@@ Y DI@@ D J@@ ES@@ US SU@@ F@@ F@@ ER AND DI@@ E ?
In the sp@@ ring of 33 C@@ .@@ E . , Jesus the Na@@ z@@ ar@@ ene was ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ted .
He had been fal@@ sel@@ y c@@ har@@ ged with se@@ dition , s@@ av@@ ag@@ ely be@@ at@@ en , and na@@ il@@ ed to a sta@@ ke .
But God raised him back to life , and 40 days later , Jesus as@@ c@@ ended to heaven .
This ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ary account comes to us from the four G@@ os@@ p@@ els of the Christian Greek Scriptures , com@@ mon@@ ly called the New T@@ est@@ am@@ ent .
On the other hand , if those events really did happen , then there is a b@@ right future for mankind , one in which you can share .
So , are the G@@ os@@ pe@@ l acc@@ oun@@ ts fact or fic@@ tion ?
Un@@ like f@@ anci@@ ful le@@ g@@ end@@ s , the G@@ os@@ pe@@ l writ@@ ings refl@@ ect p@@ ain@@ sta@@ king acc@@ ur@@ ac@@ y and attention to det@@ a@@ il .
For example , they ab@@ ound with n@@ ames of real plac@@ es , many of which can be vis@@ ited today .
They tell about real people , whose ex@@ ist@@ ence has been cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ated by sec@@ ular hist@@ or@@ ians . ​ — Luke 3 : 1 , 2 , 23 .
Jesus himself is mentioned by sec@@ ular writ@@ ers of the first and second cen@@ tu@@ ries .
* His man@@ ner of death , as describ@@ ed in the G@@ os@@ p@@ els , ag@@ re@@ es with Roman ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tion@@ al me@@ th@@ o@@ ds of the time .
Mo@@ re@@ over , events are rel@@ ated in a fac@@ tu@@ al and can@@ did man@@ ner ​ — even p@@ ort@@ ra@@ ying some of Jesus ’ disciples un@@ fav@@ or@@ ably .
All these fac@@ t@@ ors str@@ ong@@ ly indic@@ ate that the G@@ os@@ pe@@ l writ@@ ers were hon@@ est and acc@@ ur@@ ate in what they wrote about Jesus .
While it is gener@@ ally accepted that Jesus lived and died , some would question his resurrection .
Even his apostles did not believe the in@@ iti@@ al repor@@ t of his having re@@ turned to life .
All doubt was re@@ moved , however , when they and other disciples saw the resurrected Jesus on se@@ par@@ ate occasi@@ ons .
In fact , in one case , there were more than 5@@ 00 ey@@ e@@ w@@ itnesses present . ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 6 .
At the ris@@ k of being ar@@ res@@ ted and kil@@ led , the disciples courage@@ ously pro@@ cla@@ im@@ ed Jesus ’ resurrection to all ​ — even to the very ones who had ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ted him .
Would so many disciples have been so b@@ old if they were not ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely sure that Jesus had really been resurrected ?
In fact , the re@@ ality of the resurrection of Jesus is the d@@ ri@@ ving for@@ ce be@@ h@@ ind the imp@@ act that Christi@@ an@@ ity has had on the world both then and now .
The G@@ os@@ pe@@ l acc@@ oun@@ ts of Jesus ’ death and resurrection be@@ ar all the necess@@ ary mar@@ ks of an au@@ th@@ enti@@ c hist@@ or@@ ic@@ al rec@@ ord .
C@@ are@@ fully reading them will conv@@ in@@ ce you that these events really happened .
Your con@@ vic@@ tion can be fu@@ r@@ ther streng@@ th@@ ened when you understand why they took place .
T@@ ac@@ it@@ us , born about 55 C@@ .@@ E . , wrote that “ Chris@@ tu@@ s , from whom the name [ Christians ] had its ori@@ g@@ in , su@@ ffered the ex@@ tre@@ me p@@ en@@ al@@ ty during the re@@ i@@ gn of T@@ ib@@ er@@ i@@ us at the h@@ ands of one of our pro@@ c@@ ur@@ at@@ ors , P@@ on@@ ti@@ us P@@ il@@ at@@ us . ”
Jesus is also refer@@ red to by Su@@ et@@ on@@ i@@ us ( first century ) ; Jewish hist@@ ori@@ an Jos@@ e@@ ph@@ us ( first century ) ; and P@@ l@@ in@@ y the Y@@ ou@@ ng@@ er , govern@@ or of B@@ ith@@ y@@ n@@ ia ( early second century ) .
Then , too , it is un@@ likely that Jesus ’ many oppos@@ ers would wr@@ ite anything that would l@@ end cre@@ di@@ b@@ il@@ ity to the repor@@ ts about him .
Re@@ gar@@ ding Jesus ’ resurrection , Peter , one of his apostles , explained : “ God raised this one up on the th@@ ir@@ d day and allowed him to become man@@ i@@ f@@ est , not to all the people , but to w@@ itnesses appointed be@@ fore@@ hand by God , to us , who ate and d@@ ran@@ k with him after his ris@@ ing from the dead . ”
Matthe@@ w@@ ’@@ s G@@ os@@ pe@@ l tells us that when the religious enemies heard repor@@ ts of Jesus ’ resurrection , they sc@@ he@@ m@@ ed to su@@ pp@@ ress them . ​ — Matthew 28 : 11 - 15 .
Does this mean that Jesus wanted his resurrection to be kept sec@@ re@@ t ?
No , for Peter went on to say : “ He or@@ dered us to preach to the people and to give a thor@@ ough witness that this is the one dec@@ re@@ ed by God to be jud@@ ge of the living and the dead . ”
Tr@@ ue Christians have done and are doing just that . ​ — Acts 10 : 42 .
“ Th@@ r@@ ough one man [ Adam ] sin enter@@ ed into the world and death through sin . ” ​ — Romans 5 : 12
What would you say if you were asked , “ Do you want to live forever ? ”
Most people would prob@@ ably say that they want to but that they feel it is un@@ real@@ is@@ tic to consider it .
De@@ ath is a nor@@ ma@@ l part of life , they say , the natural out@@ come of our ex@@ ist@@ ence .
Su@@ pp@@ ose , though , that the question were turned around and you were asked , “ Are you ready to die ? ”
U@@ nd@@ er nor@@ ma@@ l circumstances , most people would answer no .
The Bible shows that God created humans with the desire and the will to live .
In fact , it says that “ he has even put et@@ ern@@ ity in their heart . ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 3 : 11 .
The re@@ ality , though , is that humans do not live forever .
F@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , has God done anything to re@@ me@@ dy the situation ?
The Bib@@ le@@ ’@@ s answers are hear@@ ten@@ ing , and they have a direc@@ t be@@ ar@@ ing on why Jesus su@@ ffered and died .
The first three chap@@ ters of the Bible book of Genesis tell us that God set before the first human couple , Adam and Eve , the pros@@ p@@ ect of un@@ en@@ ding life and told them what they would have to do to gain it .
Then the account describ@@ es how they fail@@ ed to obey God and lost that pros@@ p@@ ect .
The st@@ ory is told simply ​ — so simply that some are qui@@ ck to dis@@ mis@@ s it as fol@@ k@@ l@@ ore .
But Genesis , like the G@@ os@@ p@@ els , gives every indic@@ ation of being a fac@@ tu@@ al , hist@@ or@@ ic@@ al rec@@ ord .
What has been the result of A@@ d@@ am@@ ’@@ s fail@@ ure to obey ?
The Bible answers this way : “ Th@@ r@@ ough one man [ Adam ] sin enter@@ ed into the world and death through sin , and so death sp@@ read to all men because they had all sin@@ ned . ”
He thus lost the pros@@ p@@ ect of end@@ less life and even@@ tually died .
Be@@ ing his des@@ c@@ end@@ ants , we have inher@@ ited his sin@@ ful con@@ dition .
But has God done anything to re@@ me@@ dy the situation ?
Yes , God made arrang@@ em@@ ents to re@@ de@@ em , or bu@@ y back , what Adam had lost for his des@@ c@@ end@@ ants , nam@@ ely , the pros@@ p@@ ect of end@@ less life .
“ The w@@ ages sin pa@@ ys is death , ” says the Bible at Romans 6 : 23 .
This means that death is the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of sin .
Li@@ ke@@ wise , we sin and are ther@@ efore sub@@ ject to sin@@ ’@@ s w@@ ages , death .
But we were born in this sin@@ ful con@@ dition through no fa@@ ult of our own .
So God lo@@ v@@ ingly sent his Son , Jesus , to accept ‘ the w@@ ages of sin ’ for us .
Jesus ’ death op@@ ens the way to a happy , end@@ less life
Since one man , the perfect man Adam , brought sin and death on us through dis@@ obedi@@ ence , a perfect man obedi@@ ent even t@@ ill death was needed to rel@@ e@@ ase us from that bur@@ den .
The Bible explains it this way : “ Just as through the dis@@ obedi@@ ence of the one man many were made sin@@ n@@ ers , so also through the obedi@@ ence of the one person many will be made righteous . ”
He left heaven , became a perfect man * , and died in our be@@ half .
As a result , it is possible for us to have a righteous st@@ anding with God and gain the pros@@ p@@ ect of end@@ less life .
Why , though , was it necess@@ ary for Jesus to die to ac@@ compl@@ ish this ?
C@@ ould not Al@@ mi@@ ghty God have simply is@@ su@@ ed a dec@@ ree that A@@ d@@ am@@ ’@@ s des@@ c@@ end@@ ants be allowed to live forever ?
H@@ ad God set justice asi@@ de in this inst@@ ance , people might have wond@@ ered whether he would do so in other matters as well .
For example , would he be fa@@ ir in determin@@ ing who among A@@ d@@ am@@ ’@@ s off@@ sp@@ ring qual@@ i@@ fy for et@@ ern@@ al life ?
C@@ ould he be tru@@ sted to keep his promises ?
G@@ od@@ ’@@ s ad@@ her@@ ence to justice in working out our sal@@ v@@ ation is as@@ sur@@ ance to us that he will always do what is right .
By Jesus ’ sacri@@ fici@@ al death , God op@@ ened the way to end@@ less life in Par@@ adise on earth .
N@@ ote Jesus ’ words as recor@@ ded at John 3 : 16 : “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - beg@@ ot@@ ten Son , so that everyone exer@@ c@@ is@@ ing faith in him might not be destro@@ yed but have everlasting life . ”
Jesus ’ death is thus an expres@@ sion not only of G@@ od@@ ’@@ s un@@ fail@@ ing justice but , more speci@@ ally , of his great love for humans .
However , why did Jesus have to su@@ ffer and die in the p@@ ain@@ ful way that was describ@@ ed in the G@@ os@@ p@@ els ?
By sub@@ j@@ ec@@ ting himself to the ex@@ tre@@ me t@@ est and rema@@ ining faithful , Jesus refu@@ ted once and for all the D@@ ev@@ il@@ ’@@ s cla@@ im that humans would not remain loyal to God when under tri@@ al .
That cla@@ im might have seem@@ ed val@@ id after Satan ind@@ uc@@ ed perfect Adam to sin .
But Jesus ​ — who was A@@ d@@ am@@ ’@@ s perfect e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent — ​ rema@@ ined obedi@@ ent des@@ p@@ ite s@@ ev@@ ere suffering .
He thus pro@@ ved that Adam too could have obe@@ yed God if he had cho@@ s@@ en to do so .
By end@@ uring under tri@@ al , Jesus left us a mo@@ de@@ l to follow .
God re@@ war@@ ded his S@@ on@@ ’@@ s perfect obedi@@ ence , gr@@ an@@ ting Jesus immor@@ t@@ al life in heaven .
Jesus indic@@ ated what we need to do when he said : “ This means everlasting life , their coming to know you , the only true God , and the one whom you sent , Jesus Christ . ” ​ — John 17 : 3 .

Ab@@ out that time , a neigh@@ b@@ or named Mar@@ gar@@ et W@@ al@@ k@@ er , one of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , began vis@@ iting my mother and tal@@ king to her about the Bible .
But I kept tr@@ ying to listen to their discus@@ sions .
After a couple more vis@@ its , Mar@@ gar@@ et asked me , “ Do you know what G@@ od@@ ’@@ s name is ? ”
I said , “ E@@ ver@@ y@@ one knows that ​ — it@@ ’@@ s God . ”
She said , “ G@@ et your Bible and look up Psalm 8@@ 3 : 18 . ”
I did , and I dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ed that G@@ od@@ ’@@ s name is Jehovah .
I r@@ an out to my friends and told them , “ When you get home t@@ on@@ i@@ ght , look up Psalm 8@@ 3 : 18 in the Bible and see what G@@ od@@ ’@@ s name is . ”
You might say I started w@@ itness@@ ing right away .
I stu@@ died the Bible and got baptized in 19@@ 41 .
So@@ on af@@ ter@@ ward , I was as@@ si@@ gned to conduct a congregation book study .
I encouraged my mother and sib@@ l@@ ings to come , and they all began atten@@ ding the book study that I conduc@@ ted .
S@@ om@@ etimes when she was on her way , he cha@@ sed after her and p@@ ul@@ led her back into the house .
But she would just ru@@ n out the other do@@ or and go to the meeting .
I also told the of@@ fici@@ als that I would not become a sol@@ di@@ er .
In cour@@ t two we@@ ek@@ s later , the jud@@ ge said : “ If it were up to me , I@@ ’@@ d give you a life s@@ ent@@ ence .

I said , “ No , it do@@ es@@ n@@ ’@@ t . ”

I was among the Witnesses imp@@ ris@@ oned for ne@@ u@@ tr@@ ality at As@@ h@@ land , K@@ en@@ tu@@ ck@@ y
That is how we pre@@ ached in an organiz@@ ed way .
I wor@@ ri@@ ed about my family because D@@ ad had told me , “ If I can get ri@@ d of you , I can h@@ and@@ le the rest . ”

I have even made a return vis@@ it in Ch@@ ina !
She took them and told me that her name was K@@ ati@@ e .
After that , wh@@ en@@ ever she saw me , K@@ ati@@ e came over to talk to me .
I taught her the n@@ ames of fru@@ its and ve@@ get@@ ab@@ les in E@@ ngl@@ ish , and she re@@ pe@@ ated the words after me .
I also explained Bible t@@ ex@@ ts to her , and she accepted the Bible T@@ each book .
After some we@@ ek@@ s , though , she disa@@ p@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed .
The next we@@ ek , she h@@ and@@ ed me her c@@ ell ph@@ one and said , “ You talk to Ch@@ ina . ”
I said , “ I d@@ on@@ ’@@ t know any@@ body in Ch@@ ina . ”
But she in@@ sis@@ ted , so I took the ph@@ one and said , “ H@@ el@@ l@@ o , this is R@@ ob@@ is@@ on . ”
The vo@@ ice at the other end said , “ R@@ ob@@ by , this is K@@ ati@@ e .
P@@ le@@ ase teach her the way you taught me . ”
I said , “ K@@ ati@@ e , I will do the best I can .
Th@@ an@@ ks for let@@ ting me know where you are . ”
So@@ on af@@ ter@@ ward , I spoke to K@@ ati@@ e@@ ’@@ s sister for the last time .

[ 1 ] ( paragra@@ ph 14 ) See chapter 21 of the book G@@ od@@ ’@@ s Kingdom R@@ ul@@ es !
During an as@@ se@@ mb@@ ly , a brother asked me if I would like to preach .
We went to the ter@@ rit@@ ory , and he gave me some bo@@ ok@@ le@@ ts about G@@ od@@ ’@@ s Kingdom .
One of the sisters there gave us children Bible less@@ ons based on the Bible and the book The H@@ ar@@ p of God .
As a te@@ en@@ ager , I enjo@@ yed giving people hope from G@@ od@@ ’@@ s Word .
The brother sto@@ pped his b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le and asked me to si@@ t down with him on a lo@@ g .
He said : “ Who gave you authority to jud@@ ge who is a go@@ at ?
L@@ et@@ ’@@ s just be happy giving people the good news and leave the jud@@ ging to Jehovah . ”
Ano@@ ther older brother taught me that to find happ@@ iness in giving , we som@@ etimes have to endure pati@@ ently .
Y@@ ears later , his pati@@ ence was re@@ war@@ ded when his wife was baptized as one of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
After the war , I pione@@ ered for two years in sou@@ ther@@ n I@@ rel@@ and .
We did not realize how much power the pri@@ ests had .

After three we@@ ek@@ s I pro@@ pos@@ ed , and after si@@ x we@@ ek@@ s we were married .
Ma@@ x@@ ine and I were as@@ si@@ gned as mis@@ sion@@ ar@@ ies to P@@ u@@ er@@ to R@@ ic@@ o , so I never went out on the new bo@@ at .
For example , in the v@@ il@@ la@@ ge of P@@ ot@@ ala P@@ ast@@ il@@ l@@ o , there were two W@@ itness famili@@ es with many children , and I used to pl@@ ay the f@@ lu@@ te for them .
I asked one of the little gi@@ r@@ ls , H@@ il@@ da , if she wanted to come and preach with us .
We b@@ ought her a pa@@ ir , and she came preaching with us .
She was about to leave for her assignment in E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , and she said : “ You d@@ on@@ ’@@ t recogn@@ ize me , do you ?
I am the little gi@@ r@@ l from P@@ ast@@ il@@ l@@ o who had no sho@@ es . ”
At first , L@@ en@@ n@@ ar@@ t Joh@@ n@@ son and I did most of the work .
Na@@ than K@@ nor@@ r , who was then taking the lead among Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , came to P@@ u@@ er@@ to R@@ ic@@ o .
Later , he gave me strong counsel about being organiz@@ ed and said that he was disa@@ pp@@ ointed in me .

The first article shows how our faith can grow and remain strong .
Let me expl@@ ain what led to that con@@ vers@@ ation .
I W@@ A@@ S born in W@@ i@@ ch@@ ita , K@@ ans@@ as , U@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ A . , on D@@ ec@@ emb@@ er 10 , 19@@ 36 , the ol@@ des@@ t of four children .

He o@@ w@@ ned two b@@ ar@@ b@@ er@@ sho@@ ps in W@@ i@@ ch@@ ita , and the do@@ c@@ t@@ or was one of his c@@ li@@ ents !
With my parents , going to a conven@@ tion in W@@ i@@ ch@@ ita in the 19@@ 40 ’ s
With Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s bless@@ ing and their ze@@ al@@ ous work , a congregation was started .
The brother also s@@ old my c@@ ar for $ 25 .

In the ministry in Na@@ i@@ ro@@ b@@ i with Mary and Ch@@ r@@ is K@@ ana@@ i@@ ya
So@@ on after , our first daughter , Ki@@ mb@@ er@@ ly , was born , and 17 mon@@ ths later , we had S@@ te@@ ph@@ any .
We would also go c@@ am@@ p@@ ing with them and would have very enjo@@ y@@ able con@@ vers@@ ations around the c@@ am@@ p@@ fi@@ re .
We arrang@@ ed to have some who were in the full - time ministry stay in our home .
They were sho@@ c@@ ked and started to cr@@ y and said that they wanted to study .
With the help and direction of G@@ od@@ ’@@ s organization , we did our best to ra@@ ise them to love Jehovah .
On a later tri@@ p , Ki@@ mb@@ er@@ ly me@@ t one of his wor@@ k@@ mat@@ es , B@@ ri@@ an L@@ le@@ wel@@ ly@@ n .
So they did stay free until they were at le@@ ast 23 .
At the same time , B@@ ri@@ an and Ki@@ mb@@ er@@ ly were inv@@ ited to work at L@@ ond@@ on Bethel and later were trans@@ f@@ er@@ red to M@@ ala@@ w@@ i Bethel .
The day after we left for the Watchtower E@@ duc@@ ation@@ al C@@ en@@ ter in P@@ at@@ ter@@ son , L@@ in@@ da called to tell us that M@@ other had died .

I was only ei@@ ght years old at the time .
My father did not want my mother to talk to me about what she was lear@@ ning .
However , I was cu@@ ri@@ ous and asked questions , so she stu@@ died with me when my father was out of the house .
As a result , I too decided that I wanted to dedic@@ ate my life to Jehovah .
My mother said that I should first speak to the serv@@ ant to the bre@@ th@@ re@@ n ( now called a circu@@ it overse@@ er ) .
He said , “ G@@ o for it ! ”
After four mon@@ ths , I sel@@ ected a brother as my pioneer par@@ t@@ ner .
My mother pione@@ ered with a sister in another congregation .
In 19@@ 5@@ 1 , I fil@@ led out an app@@ lic@@ ation to atten@@ d the Watchtower Bible S@@ chool of G@@ ile@@ ad .

In the Ser@@ m@@ on on the M@@ ount , Jesus said : “ Re@@ jo@@ ice and be over@@ jo@@ yed , since your re@@ ward is great in the heavens , for in that way they persec@@ u@@ ted the prophe@@ ts pri@@ or to you . ”
Moses told the nation of Israel : “ Jehovah will su@@ rely bl@@ ess you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to pos@@ s@@ ess as an inher@@ it@@ ance , but only if you stri@@ c@@ tly obey the vo@@ ice of Jehovah your God and carefully ob@@ serve all this command@@ ment that I am giving you today .

D@@ is@@ courage@@ ment is temp@@ or@@ ary if we focus on Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s promises .
Jehovah is always there to help us , regar@@ d@@ less of our circumstances . ”
Yet , you can likely think of ways in which Jehovah has re@@ war@@ ded you and those around you .

The J@@ uly 15 , 2013 , issue of The Watchtower explained that “ the faithful and dis@@ cre@@ et slave ” is a small group of anointed brothers who make up the G@@ over@@ ning Bo@@ dy .
So how can we answer Jesus ’ question : “ Who really is the faithful and dis@@ cre@@ et slave ? ”
How has holy spirit helped the G@@ over@@ ning Bo@@ dy ?
( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 10 . )
What is one way to remember the G@@ over@@ ning Bo@@ dy ?

My d@@ ad , C@@ lar@@ ence , and later my un@@ c@@ le Al@@ f@@ red , served as comp@@ any serv@@ ant ( now called co@@ or@@ din@@ at@@ or of the body of elders ) in our small congregation in C@@ ond@@ e , S@@ ou@@ th D@@ a@@ kota .
My sister , D@@ or@@ othy , and I became Kingdom publ@@ ish@@ ers when we were si@@ x .
Con@@ ven@@ tions and as@@ se@@ mb@@ lies were an important part of our lives .
The Bible says : “ The one wal@@ king with the wise will become wise , ” and there were many wise ones in my family who suppor@@ ted my decision to pioneer .
When they were serving congregations ne@@ ar@@ by , they som@@ etimes inv@@ ited me to go with them in the ministry .

The Bible says that N@@ ec@@ ho@@ ’@@ s words were “ from the m@@ ou@@ th of God . ”
Let us medit@@ ate on these Bible acc@@ oun@@ ts and be than@@ k@@ ful that Jehovah has provi@@ ded them for us !
How many vo@@ ws have you made to Jehovah ?
What about your dedic@@ ation vo@@ w or your marriage vo@@ w ?
When we believe that we have person@@ ally experienced or ob@@ served an in@@ justice , our faith , humility , and loy@@ al@@ ty may be t@@ ested .
“ The world is pas@@ sing away and so is its desire , but the one who does the will of God rema@@ ins forever . ” ​ — 1 J@@ O@@ H@@ N 2 : 17 .
What will Jehovah do about wicked people and cor@@ rup@@ t organiz@@ ations ?
The Bible says : “ The world is pas@@ sing away . ”
There is no d@@ ar@@ k@@ ness or deep sha@@ do@@ w where wr@@ ong@@ do@@ ers can conc@@ e@@ al themselves . ”
Later in the same p@@ sal@@ m , we read : “ The righteous will pos@@ s@@ ess the earth , and they will live forever on it . ”
Who are “ the me@@ ek ” and “ the righteous ” ?
Why can we be sure that the new earth will be well - organiz@@ ed ?

I@@ l@@ lustr@@ ate . ( b ) How can we be sure that we will remain after this old world is g@@ one ?
“ W@@ IL@@ L the Ju@@ dge of all the earth not do what is right ? ”
Because Jehovah is the greatest example of justice and righteousness .
Christians exp@@ ect to experience some in@@ justice out@@ side the Christian congregation .
In 19@@ 46 , he at@@ tend@@ ed the ei@@ gh@@ th cl@@ as@@ s of G@@ ile@@ ad S@@ chool in New Y@@ or@@ k , U@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ A .
After gra@@ du@@ ation , he was even@@ tually as@@ si@@ gned to the circu@@ it work in S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land .

( Read Matthew 5 : 23 , 24 ; 18 : 15 . )
Lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty to Jehovah and to our brothers will protect us from making such a mis@@ take .
Most important , he did not allow the im@@ perf@@ ec@@ tions and wrong actions of others to se@@ par@@ ate him from Jehovah .
Why should we draw even closer to Jehovah if we experience in@@ justice in the congregation ?
How can we show that we have confidence in “ the Ju@@ dge of all the earth ” ?
See W@@ il@@ l@@ i Di@@ e@@ h@@ l@@ ’@@ s life st@@ ory , “ Jehovah Is My God , in W@@ ho@@ m I Will Tr@@ ust , ” in the No@@ ve@@ mb@@ er 1 , 199@@ 1 , issue of The Watchtower .

( a ) What temp@@ tation do refu@@ ge@@ es need to res@@ ist ?
F@@ in@@ ally , he hel@@ d up the em@@ p@@ ty ba@@ g and said with a s@@ mil@@ e : ‘ You see ?
This is all you need ! ’ ” ​ — Read 1 Timothy 6 : 8 .
They need to sense Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s love and compas@@ sion among their fellow Christians .
Many of to@@ da@@ y@@ ’@@ s refu@@ ge@@ es come from coun@@ tries where our preaching work is res@@ tri@@ c@@ ted .
She said : “ The brothers there tre@@ ated them like close rel@@ ati@@ ves , provi@@ ding food , clo@@ th@@ es , s@@ hel@@ ter , and tr@@ an@@ sp@@ ort@@ ation .
Who else would wel@@ come str@@ ang@@ ers into their home just because they worship the same God ?
On@@ ly Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses ! ” ​ — Read John 13 : 35 .
As soon as possible after a refu@@ ge@@ e arri@@ ves , elders should follow the direction in O@@ r@@ ganiz@@ ed to Do Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Will , chapter 8 , paragra@@ ph 30 .
In the mean@@ time , they can ask dis@@ cre@@ et questions about a refu@@ ge@@ e@@ ’@@ s congregation and ministry to dis@@ cer@@ n his spiritual con@@ dition .

3 , 4 . ( a ) How can parents set a good example for their children ?
( b ) What should parents not exp@@ ect of their children ?
When your children see you “ see@@ king first the Kingdom , ” they learn to de@@ p@@ end on Jehovah for their da@@ ily needs .
N@@ ever get so bus@@ y that you do not have time for your children .
How may your children benefit from lear@@ ning your language ?
Par@@ ents , if that describ@@ es your children , can you learn at le@@ ast some of the lo@@ cal language ?
A child who communic@@ ates best in another sp@@ ok@@ en language des@@ er@@ ves the same concer@@ n , would you not ag@@ ree ?
If that is your situation , you can still help your children to come to know and love Jehovah .
How can parents help children who may need to study in two languages ?
( a ) Who must deci@@ de which language congregation to atten@@ d ?
That may not be the case when children do not fully understand the language .
( Read 1 Corinthians 14 : 9 , 11 . )
The answer was not what we person@@ ally found conv@@ eni@@ ent .
But when we saw that they were get@@ ting little benefit from the meetings in our language , we decided to move to the lo@@ cal - language congregation .
To@@ gether , we regularly at@@ tend@@ ed meetings and s@@ har@@ ed in the ministry .
We also inv@@ ited lo@@ cal friends to jo@@ in us for me@@ als and exc@@ ur@@ sions .
All of this helped our children to get to know the brothers and to get to know Jehovah , not only as their God but also as their Father and F@@ ri@@ end .
We consi@@ dered this to be much more important than their ma@@ st@@ ering our language . ”
Samuel ad@@ ds : “ To keep ourselves spiritually strong , my wife and I also at@@ tend@@ ed meetings in our language .
Li@@ fe was very bus@@ y , and we were ti@@ red .
But we than@@ k Jehovah for bless@@ ing our efforts and sacrific@@ es .
Our three children are all serving Jehovah in the full - time ministry . ”
“ I knew the bas@@ ic@@ s of my parents ’ language , but the language sp@@ ok@@ en at the meetings was over my head , ” rec@@ al@@ ls K@@ ris@@ t@@ ina .
“ When I was 12 , I at@@ tend@@ ed a conven@@ tion in my school language .
For the first time , I underst@@ ood that what I was hear@@ ing was the truth !
Ano@@ ther tur@@ ning point came when I began to pray in my school language .
I could speak to Jehovah from my heart ! ”
Y@@ oung people , do you think that you would pre@@ f@@ er being part of a lo@@ cal - language congregation ?
“ When my sib@@ l@@ ings and I got into our te@@ ens , we wanted to sw@@ it@@ ch to the lo@@ cal - language congregation , ” says Na@@ dia , who now ser@@ ves at Bethel .
“ Now we@@ ’@@ re grateful that our parents wor@@ ked hard to teach us their language and kept us in the fore@@ i@@ gn - language congregation .
It has en@@ ri@@ ch@@ ed our lives and bro@@ ad@@ ened our opportun@@ ities to help others get to know Jehovah . ”
( b ) How can parents get help in teaching their children the truth ?
( Read Proverbs 1 : 8 ; 31 : 10 , 27 , 28 . )
Still , parents who do not know the lo@@ cal language may need help to reach their chil@@ dr@@ en@@ ’@@ s heart .
B@@ oth children and parents benefit from associ@@ ation with the congregation ( See paragra@@ ph@@ s 18 , 19 )
( b ) What must parents continue to do ?
“ When they helped me with stud@@ ent talk assign@@ ments for the meeting , I always learned more .
And I enjo@@ yed the le@@ is@@ ure activ@@ ities we s@@ har@@ ed in as a group . ”
Par@@ ents , pray to Jehovah for help , and try your best .

When she wanted to get baptized , her parents told her , “ Bec@@ ome one of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , and you will have to leave our home ! ”
She continued her study and later got baptized .

How can we keep our love for Jehovah strong ?
How can we deep@@ en our love for Bible truth ?
Why is it important to have aff@@ ection for our brothers ?
What may have ca@@ used the love of some Christians to grow c@@ old ?
People today have less and less love for God .
This is the greatest and first command@@ ment . ”
S@@ how love for Jehovah ( See paragra@@ ph 10 )
( Read Psalm 119 : 9@@ 7 - 100 . )
S@@ how love for Bible truth ( See paragra@@ ph 14 )
On his last night on earth , Jesus said to his disciples : “ I am giving you a new command@@ ment , that you love one another ; just as I have loved you , you also love one another .
By this all will know that you are my disciples ​ — if you have love among y@@ ourselves . ” ​ — John 13 : 34 , 35 .
The apostle John wrote : “ The one who does not love his brother , whom he has seen , cannot love God , whom he has not seen . ”
S@@ how love for the brothers and sisters ( See paragra@@ ph 17 )
What are some ways in which we can show love ?
Read 1 Thessalon@@ ians 4 : 9 , 10 .
“ Sim@@ on son of John , do you love me more than these ? ” ​ — J@@ O@@ H@@ N 21 : 15 .
Then he said to them : “ ‘ C@@ ast the ne@@ t on the right side of the bo@@ at and you will find some . ’
So they c@@ ast it , but they were not able to ha@@ u@@ l it in because of the large number of f@@ ish . ” ​ — John 21 : 1 - 6 .
( b ) What valu@@ able less@@ on did a brother in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and learn about his work ?
As a result , it left me al@@ most no time for spiritual matters .
I fin@@ ally real@@ ized that in order to put Kingdom inter@@ ests first , I needed to change my l@@ ine of work . ”
“ After pl@@ an@@ ning for about a year , ” he explained , “ I decided to become a st@@ re@@ et v@@ end@@ or and sel@@ l ice cre@@ am .
In the beg@@ in@@ ning , I str@@ u@@ gg@@ led fin@@ anci@@ ally and got dis@@ coura@@ ged .

I prayed to Jehovah , as@@ king him to help me to co@@ pe and to reach my go@@ al of having more time for spiritual activ@@ ities .
I got better ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ ted with my cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers ’ ta@@ st@@ es and became more s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful in making ice cre@@ am .
So@@ on , I was sel@@ ling all my ice cre@@ am every day .
Ac@@ tually , I was better - off fin@@ anci@@ ally than when I wor@@ ked with com@@ pu@@ ters .
It has made me happ@@ ier because I do not have the st@@ ress and wor@@ ry that I had with my form@@ er jo@@ b .
And most important , I now feel closer to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Matthew 5 : 3 , 6 .
After his bap@@ t@@ ism , he said : “ The only reg@@ re@@ t I have is that I lost so much time before I real@@ ized that serving Jehovah br@@ ings far more happ@@ iness than pur@@ su@@ ing the enter@@ tain@@ ment offered by this world . ”
Jesus said : “ Wh@@ ere your tre@@ asure is , there your heart will be also . ”
Jesus st@@ ated that “ no one can slave for two ma@@ st@@ ers . ”
He ad@@ ded : “ You cannot slave for God and for R@@ i@@ ches . ”

What is the “ tre@@ asure st@@ ore ” that Jesus refer@@ red to at Matthew 13 : 5@@ 2 , and how do we fill it ?
( Read Proverbs 2 : 4 - 7 . )
Consider the experience of a brother named Peter .
To t@@ est Peter , the r@@ ab@@ b@@ i asked , “ So , my bo@@ y , what language was the book of Daniel written in ? ”
When I went home and c@@ he@@ c@@ ked the Watchtower and A@@ wa@@ ke !
ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ines from the pre@@ vi@@ ous mon@@ ths , I found an article explain@@ ing that Daniel was written in A@@ ra@@ ma@@ ic . ”
As you do this , you will build up “ tre@@ asure in the heavens , where no th@@ i@@ ef ge@@ ts near and no m@@ oth con@@ su@@ m@@ es .
For where your tre@@ asure is , there your hearts will be also . ” ​ — Luke 12 : 33 , 34 .

As my ir@@ rit@@ ation gre@@ w , I started being c@@ ur@@ t with her .
I thought , ‘ She does not show me the respect I des@@ er@@ ve , so I am not going to show her respect . ’ ”
“ I began see@@ ing my own personality f@@ laws , and I was very disa@@ pp@@ ointed in my@@ self .
I real@@ ized that I had to ad@@ just my thinking .

How do you know that Jehovah wants you to pl@@ an for a happy future ?
Your Creator is “ the God of love , ” “ the happy God , ” who made humans “ in his i@@ mage . ”
You will be happy when you imitate our loving God .
Jesus Christ set the perfect example for you young ones .

I also made friends in a ne@@ ar@@ by V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese - language congregation .
When I was 18 , I started pione@@ ering .
Later , I at@@ tend@@ ed the Bible S@@ chool for S@@ ing@@ le Bro@@ thers .
This helped me with my present pioneer assignment , where I am the only elder in a V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese - language group .
Many V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese people are a@@ ma@@ zed that I have learned their language .
They inv@@ ite me in , and often I can study the Bible with them .

If we have faith like that of Mic@@ ah , we will be willing to wa@@ it for Jehovah .
So we “ endure fully with pati@@ ence and joy . ”
Abraham had to wa@@ it many years before his gr@@ and@@ sons E@@ sa@@ u and Jacob were born ( See paragra@@ ph@@ s 9 , 10 )
( Read Hebrews 11 : 8 - 12 . )
But just imagine Ab@@ raha@@ m@@ ’@@ s joy when he is resurrected back to a par@@ adise earth .
Although you me@@ ant to har@@ m me , God in@@ tend@@ ed it to turn out well and to pres@@ er@@ ve many people al@@ ive , as he is doing today . ”
( b ) What helped David to wa@@ it pati@@ ently ?

What will help us to be willing to wa@@ it pati@@ ently ?
What less@@ ons do we learn from what happened to the apostle Paul in Philipp@@ i ?
( Read Acts 16 : 8 - 10 . )
So@@ on after he arri@@ ved in M@@ ac@@ e@@ d@@ on@@ ia , he ended up in pris@@ on !
Why did Jehovah allow this to happen to Paul ?
B@@ oth he and S@@ il@@ as started “ pra@@ ying and pra@@ is@@ ing God with son@@ g . ”
4 , 5 . ( a ) How could our situation be similar to that of Paul ?
( b ) How did P@@ a@@ ul@@ ’@@ s situation change un@@ exp@@ ec@@ te@@ dly ?
What will we now discuss and re@@ view together ?

( a ) What less@@ on do we learn from what happened to Joseph ?
No doubt Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s actions exc@@ e@@ e@@ ded all of Jos@@ e@@ ph@@ ’@@ s exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations .
Think , too , about Jos@@ e@@ ph@@ ’@@ s great - gr@@ and@@ mother Sarah .
( Read Isaiah 43 : 10 - 13 . )
We know that Jehovah car@@ es for us and wants us to succ@@ eed .
How can we stri@@ p off and keep off the old personality ?
By 19@@ 39 there were 6@@ ,000 of them in the [ con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ation c@@ am@@ ps ] . ”
But the more I had sex@@ ual rel@@ ations , the more in@@ sec@@ ure I felt . ”
This way of life continued until Sa@@ kur@@ a was 23 years old .
It got so bad that I could not wa@@ it for the woman I was living with to leave the house so that I could w@@ atch por@@ no@@ gra@@ p@@ hi@@ c vi@@ de@@ o@@ s . ”
What helped S@@ te@@ p@@ hen to put away anger and ab@@ u@@ sive spe@@ ec@@ h ?
He says : “ Our family life im@@ pro@@ ved dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c@@ ally .
Today , S@@ te@@ p@@ hen ser@@ ves as a minis@@ ter@@ ial serv@@ ant , and his wife has been a regul@@ ar pioneer for sever@@ al years .
Bible t@@ ex@@ ts that encouraged me were Isaiah 55 : 7 , which says : ‘ Let the wicked man leave his way , ’ and 1 Corinthians 6 : 11 , which says about those who had ab@@ and@@ oned sin@@ ful ways : ‘ And yet that is what some of you were . ’
For many years , Jehovah pati@@ ently helped me by means of his holy spirit to put on the new personality . ”
We also benefit from G@@ od@@ ’@@ s Word and his holy spirit when we prepare for and atten@@ d congregation meetings .
Some of the n@@ ames in this article have been changed .

What example did Jesus set in sho@@ wing mil@@ dness and pati@@ ence ?
Then he ad@@ ded : “ If you continue sho@@ wing fav@@ or@@ it@@ ism , you are comm@@ it@@ ting sin . ”
Why is it important that we clo@@ the ourselves with love ?
Lo@@ ve is also “ pati@@ ent and kind ” and “ does not get pu@@ ff@@ ed up . ”
Paul said that without love , he was “ nothing . ”
The love is in this respect , not that we have loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son as a prop@@ iti@@ at@@ ory sacrifice for our sins . ”
Jesus said : “ No one has love greater than this , that someone should sur@@ r@@ end@@ er his life in be@@ half of his friends . ”
Let us consider how we can do so .
John wrote : “ L@@ it@@ tle children , we should love , not in word or with the tong@@ ue , but in de@@ ed and truth . ”
But then I asked my@@ self , ‘ How can I imitate Jesus in de@@ al@@ ing with this person ? ’
After refl@@ ec@@ ting on what Jesus would have done , I decided to let the matter go and not make an issue of it .
Later , I learned that my co@@ wor@@ k@@ er had been co@@ p@@ ing with a serious health proble@@ m and was under a lot of st@@ ress .
I conclu@@ ded that she prob@@ ably did not really mean what she wrote .
Re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ting on Jesus ’ example of sho@@ wing love even when pro@@ vo@@ ked helped me to show similar love to my co@@ wor@@ k@@ er . ”
By le@@ av@@ ing heaven , “ he em@@ p@@ ti@@ ed himself ” in our be@@ half , even “ to the point of death . ”
P@@ E@@ AC@@ E : “ P@@ ut@@ ting up with one another in love ” al@@ lo@@ ws us to enjoy “ the un@@ iting b@@ ond of peace . ”
Would you not ag@@ ree that such a pe@@ ac@@ eful spirit is truly uni@@ q@@ ue in to@@ da@@ y@@ ’@@ s div@@ i@@ ded world ?
Paul wrote : “ Lo@@ ve buil@@ ds up . ”
B@@ el@@ o@@ w the pic@@ ture was the cap@@ tion : “ In@@ v@@ asi@@ on of the st@@ ree@@ ts . ”

We read : “ Jehovah the God of their fore@@ fa@@ thers kept warning them by means of his mes@@ s@@ eng@@ ers , warning them again and again , because he felt compas@@ sion for his people and for his d@@ wel@@ ling place . ”
“ He started to teach them many things . ”
Instead , we need to do all we can now to help people .
One meaning of compas@@ sion is “ to su@@ ffer together . ”

How can Psalm 37 : 25 and Hebrews 13 : 5 help parents ?
( Read Psalm 37 : 25 ; Hebrews 13 : 5 . )
A brother who has two children wrote : “ Many parents exp@@ end much effor@@ t and res@@ our@@ c@@ es helping their children reach go@@ als in such are@@ as as sp@@ or@@ ts , rec@@ re@@ ation , and e@@ duc@@ ation .
It makes so much more sense to exp@@ end effor@@ t and res@@ our@@ c@@ es in helping our children reach go@@ als that will help them to main@@ tain a good st@@ anding with Jehovah .
It has been a great s@@ our@@ ce of satis@@ fac@@ tion not only to see our children reach spiritual go@@ als but to share the j@@ our@@ ne@@ y with them . ”
G@@ ive examples of courage in the Christian congregation .
( a ) How can baptized brothers be courage@@ ous ?
( Read Philippians 2 : 13 ; 4 : 13 . )
We ur@@ ge all baptized brothers to be courage@@ ous and work hard for the congregation !

Those ver@@ ses lik@@ en G@@ od@@ ’@@ s Word to a mi@@ r@@ r@@ or in which we can see ourselves the way Jehovah se@@ es us .
I began to wond@@ er if what I saw in my@@ self was different from what Jehovah saw .
At first , I res@@ is@@ ted this new ide@@ a .
I still felt that loving me was too much to exp@@ ect of Jehovah .
“ A few days later , I read a s@@ crip@@ ture that changed my life .
The verse was Isaiah 1 : 18 , where Jehovah is qu@@ ot@@ ed as saying : ‘ C@@ ome , now , you people , and let us set matters st@@ ra@@ i@@ ght between us . . . .
Tho@@ u@@ gh the sins of you people should prove to be as s@@ car@@ let , they will be made wh@@ ite just like s@@ now . ’

I know you , I know your sins , I know your heart ​ — and I love you . ’
“ I was un@@ able to s@@ le@@ ep that night .
I still doub@@ ted that Jehovah could love me , but I began thinking about Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice .
All of a su@@ d@@ den , it da@@ w@@ ned on me that Jehovah had been pati@@ ent with me for so long , sho@@ wing me that he loved me in so many ways .
Yet , I was , in eff@@ ect , saying to him : ‘ Your love is not great enough to reach me .
Your S@@ on@@ ’@@ s sacrifice is not enough to co@@ ver me . ’
It was as if I had been th@@ ro@@ wing the ransom back at Jehovah .
But now , at last , by medit@@ ating on this gift of the ransom , I began to feel loved by Jehovah . ”

What will happen to some anointed ones during Chris@@ t@@ ’@@ s pres@@ ence ?

We the living who survi@@ ve to the pres@@ ence of the Lord will in no way p@@ rec@@ e@@ de those who have fal@@ l@@ en as@@ le@@ ep in death ; because the Lord himself will des@@ c@@ end from heaven with a com@@ man@@ ding c@@ all , . . . and those who are dead in uni@@ on with Christ will ris@@ e first .

We were even able to bu@@ y the pro@@ per@@ ty from the man who had said that “ Ch@@ in@@ ese do not sel@@ l . ”
The ne@@ w@@ ly f@@ er@@ t@@ il@@ ized e@@ g@@ g might grow in a F@@ al@@ lo@@ pi@@ an tu@@ be ( an ec@@ to@@ pi@@ c pre@@ gn@@ anc@@ y ) or might trav@@ el into the w@@ om@@ b .
That would end the pre@@ gn@@ anc@@ y at an early st@@ age .
A gui@@ de from E@@ ngl@@ and@@ ’@@ s N@@ ation@@ al He@@ al@@ th Ser@@ vice repor@@ ts : “ I@@ U@@ D@@ s with more co@@ pp@@ er are more than 9@@ 9 % eff@@ ective .
This means that fe@@ wer than one in 100 women who use an I@@ U@@ D will get pre@@ gn@@ ant in one year .
I@@ U@@ D@@ s with less co@@ pp@@ er will be less eff@@ ective . ”
( a ) What does “ per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed to believe ” mean ?
( b ) How do we know that Timothy was per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed to believe the good news about Jesus ?
F@@ ran@@ k@@ ly , I would wor@@ ry if she accepted something without as@@ king questions . ”
Does the Bib@@ le@@ ’@@ s expl@@ an@@ ation make sense to them ?
What should be an important part of your teaching ?
S@@ te@@ ph@@ an@@ ie , the mother of three daugh@@ ters , says : “ E@@ ver since my children were very young , I have had to ask my@@ self , ‘ Do I talk to my children about why I am convinc@@ ed of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s ex@@ ist@@ ence , his love , and the righ@@ t@@ ness of his ways ?
Can my children clearly see that I really love Jehovah ? ’
I can@@ ’@@ t exp@@ ect my children to be per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed un@@ less I am . ”
The Bible says that “ fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ness is b@@ ound up in the heart of a child . ”
That kind of wisdom is necess@@ ary for sal@@ v@@ ation .
How can parents help their children to become “ wise for sal@@ v@@ ation ” ?
Lo@@ ok under BI@@ BLE T@@ E@@ AC@@ H@@ ING@@ S > BI@@ BLE S@@ TU@@ D@@ Y TO@@ O@@ L@@ S .
How can you work out your own sal@@ v@@ ation ?
They may have been raised in the truth .
But in a few years when the ur@@ ge to have se@@ x becom@@ es str@@ ong@@ er , he or she needs to be thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly convinc@@ ed that obe@@ ying Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s laws is always the best cho@@ ice . ”
( b ) What can you learn from Philippians 4 : 11 - 13 ?
What does it mean to work out your own sal@@ v@@ ation “ with fear and tre@@ mb@@ ling ” ?
What to@@ ol@@ s have helped you in your personal study ?
I should feel free to do the same .
So I@@ ’@@ l@@ l men@@ tion something in pas@@ sing , such as , ‘ I was teaching the Bible the other day , and . . . ’
Then I continue with the point of my st@@ ory .
Although the im@@ medi@@ ate point is not in it@@ self about the Bible , often others are cu@@ ri@@ ous about what I do when teaching the Bible .
The more I use this appro@@ ach , the eas@@ ier it ge@@ ts .
And af@@ ter@@ ward , I always feel great ! ”
We are the only Witnesses they are ex@@ pos@@ ed to .
So the way we act can determin@@ e how they will resp@@ ond .
What if we are sh@@ y or tim@@ id or have a hard time spe@@ aking up about our faith , or what if we cr@@ ing@@ e when we do speak up ?
Then they may look at us as if we ar@@ en@@ ’@@ t pr@@ ou@@ d of who we are .
They may even resp@@ ond un@@ kind@@ ly because of our l@@ ack of confidence .
However , if we talk with e@@ ase and as@@ sur@@ ance about what we believe , making it a nor@@ ma@@ l part of con@@ vers@@ ation , it@@ ’@@ s more likely that they will respect us . ”
Jesus said : “ If anyone wants to come after me , let him dis@@ own himself and pic@@ k up his t@@ or@@ ture sta@@ ke and keep following me . ”

What less@@ on can we learn from Isaiah 40 : 26 ?
No one has been able to coun@@ t all the star@@ s in the uni@@ verse .
How can we be sure that Jehovah is able to strengthen us ?
And he ad@@ ded : “ You will find ref@@ res@@ h@@ ment for y@@ ourselves .
But how do we feel when we return ?
The information was pres@@ ented in such an em@@ pa@@ the@@ tic and concer@@ ned way that I was moved to t@@ ears .
I was remin@@ ded that the meetings are where I need to be . ”
What did the apostle Paul mean when he wrote : “ When I am we@@ ak , then I am powerful ” ?
He san@@ g : “ With your help I can c@@ har@@ ge against a mar@@ au@@ der b@@ and ; by G@@ od@@ ’@@ s power I can s@@ cal@@ e a w@@ all . ”
Or will we follow the Bib@@ le@@ ’@@ s wise advice to se@@ t@@ tle matters qui@@ ck@@ ly ?
You might beg@@ in the con@@ vers@@ ation by saying something like this , “ Perhaps I am being over@@ ly sen@@ s@@ itive , but when you spoke to me y@@ es@@ ter@@ day , I felt . . . ”
For day and night your hand was heav@@ y upon me . ”

( Read 2 Corinthians 8 : 18 - 21 . )
Your d@@ on@@ ations help our worl@@ d@@ wide work ( See paragra@@ ph@@ s 14 - 16 )
As a result , we som@@ etimes feel is@@ ol@@ ated , and we eas@@ ily for@@ get the s@@ co@@ pe of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s work .
But as soon as we w@@ atch the var@@ ious pro@@ gr@@ am@@ s on J@@ W Bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast@@ ing , we remember that we are part of an inter@@ n@@ ation@@ al bro@@ ther@@ ho@@ od .
Our de@@ ar lo@@ cal brothers and sisters are very exc@@ ited about J@@ W Bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast@@ ing .
We often hear them say that after w@@ atch@@ ing the mon@@ th@@ ly pro@@ gr@@ am@@ s , they feel close to the members of the G@@ over@@ ning Bo@@ dy .
Now they are pr@@ ou@@ der than ever to be part of G@@ od@@ ’@@ s organization . ”
( Read Proverbs 11 : 24 , 25 . )

What does the Bible say about ri@@ ches and po@@ ver@@ ty ?
He wrote : “ So that I do not become satis@@ fied and d@@ en@@ y you and say , ‘ Who is Jehovah ? ’ ”
She would say , ‘ I have the greatest b@@ os@@ s ever ! ’
Now that I too am pione@@ ering , we both work for the same Per@@ son , Jehovah . ”
How can we avoid becom@@ ing lo@@ v@@ ers of money ?
It means that they do not love God at all . ”
How can we avoid becom@@ ing lo@@ v@@ ers of ple@@ a@@ sures ?
( Read 2 Timothy 3 : 1 - 5 , 13 . )
We also know that love “ does not b@@ ra@@ g , does not get pu@@ ff@@ ed up . ”

( Read Daniel 6 : 7 - 10 . )
( Read Job 31 : 24 - 28 . )
( Read Psalm 11 : 5 ; 26 : 4 . )
So ask yourself , ‘ Do I know Jehovah as well as Noah , Daniel , and Job did ? ’
No@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s great - gr@@ and@@ father Eno@@ ch also “ kept wal@@ king with the true God . ”
Jesus said : “ Abraham your father re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed great@@ ly at the pros@@ p@@ ect of see@@ ing my day . ”
I@@ t@@ ’@@ s hard for me to expres@@ s the joy we feel . ”
For it is to us God has reve@@ aled them through his spirit . ”
Jesus said : “ These things I have sp@@ ok@@ en to you , so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be made full . ”

As a result , I did not d@@ ress very mo@@ des@@ tly .
But lear@@ ning the truth moved me to make the needed effor@@ t to be a spiritual person .
Ma@@ king changes was not easy , but I became happ@@ ier and found real purpose in life . ”
So being like Jesus makes us more like Jehovah .
They said : “ We are w@@ itnesses of all the things he did . ”
How will having the mind of Christ affect your da@@ ily life ?
He says : “ I never did anything wrong , but I was just going through the moti@@ ons .
I loo@@ ked spiritually strong , being at all the meetings and serving as an au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary pioneer a few times a year .
He says : “ It was as if I knew nothing .
I thought to my@@ self , ‘ If I am going to be my wi@@ fe@@ ’@@ s spiritual head , I have to do something . ’ ”
I got understanding and , most important , devel@@ op@@ ed a close relationship with Jehovah . ”
( 3 ) How can strong spiritu@@ ality help us in our da@@ ily life ?
( b ) What is our go@@ al when we study and medit@@ ate ?
( b ) What Bible example can we imitate ?

He told Jehovah that he was so happy about his little gi@@ r@@ l@@ ’@@ s decision to dedic@@ ate her life to H@@ im . ”
( Read 1 Peter 3 : 20 , 21 . )
Why do we not pres@@ sure anyone to get baptized ?
If you are a par@@ ent , you may have asked yourself : ‘ Is my child really ready to get baptized ?
The first question is , “ On the bas@@ is of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ , have you rep@@ ented of your sins and dedic@@ ated yourself to Jehovah to do his will ? ”
How can we be ho@@ sp@@ it@@ able at our Christian meetings ?
( Read 3 John 5 - 8 . )
He wr@@ ites : “ I h@@ es@@ it@@ ated in@@ iti@@ ally because we were ne@@ w@@ ly married and living in a small house .
But having stud@@ ents stay with us was truly a jo@@ y@@ ous experience .
As ne@@ w@@ ly@@ we@@ ds , we were able to see how happy a couple can be when they serve Jehovah and pur@@ sue spiritual go@@ als together . ”
Why may those who are new to your congregation need ho@@ sp@@ it@@ ality ?
( Read Luke 10 : 41 , 42 . )
One even@@ ing my wife was par@@ tic@@ ul@@ arly ho@@ mes@@ ic@@ k , and my efforts to help were not working .

There sto@@ od a Bible stud@@ ent who brought us three or@@ ang@@ es .
She had come to wel@@ come the new mis@@ sion@@ ar@@ ies .
We inv@@ ited her in and gave her a gl@@ as@@ s of water .

But as with anything in rel@@ ation to serving Jehovah , the benef@@ its and satis@@ fac@@ tion that result far ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh any anxi@@ ety .
I have enjo@@ yed simply s@@ it@@ ting down with gu@@ ests over c@@ of@@ fe@@ e and tal@@ king . ”
Ano@@ ther elder wr@@ ites : “ H@@ av@@ ing friends from the congregation to my home helps me to understand them better and gives me time to get to know them , especially how they came into the truth . ”
The wife of one of the instruc@@ t@@ ors really put me at e@@ ase .
She said that when she and her husband are serving in the travel@@ ing work , their best we@@ ek@@ s are those sp@@ ent sta@@ ying with a spiritual person who may not have much mater@@ i@@ ally but who has the same focus as they have ​ — serving Jehovah and ke@@ ep@@ ing life sim@@ ple .

The elder rec@@ al@@ led : “ G@@ raham had a proble@@ m with pri@@ de .
He was cr@@ itical of the elders who had been involved in his dis@@ fel@@ low@@ shipp@@ ing .
So for the next few stu@@ dies , we discus@@ sed s@@ criptu@@ res on pri@@ de and its eff@@ ects .
G@@ raham began to see himself clearly in the mi@@ r@@ r@@ or of G@@ od@@ ’@@ s Word , and he did not like what he saw !
After ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging that he had been bl@@ in@@ ded by a ‘ ra@@ f@@ ter ’ of pri@@ de and that his cr@@ itical attitude was his proble@@ m , he began to change qui@@ ck@@ ly for the better .
He started to atten@@ d Christian meetings regularly , to study G@@ od@@ ’@@ s Word ear@@ n@@ es@@ tly , and to make da@@ ily prayer a hab@@ it .
‘ I@@ ’@@ ve known the truth for years , ’ he said , ‘ and I@@ ’@@ ve even served as a pioneer .

( b ) How did one family benefit from the parents ’ obedi@@ ence to Jehovah ?
Some years later , the daughter was re@@ inst@@ ated .
( b ) How can we make the elders ’ work more pleas@@ ant for them ?
They did not b@@ er@@ ate me or cr@@ iti@@ ci@@ ze me , but they encouraged me and streng@@ th@@ ened me .
After every congregation meeting , no matter how bus@@ y they were , at le@@ ast one of them would ask how I was .
Because of my past , I found it difficult to feel wor@@ thy of G@@ od@@ ’@@ s love .
Tim@@ e and time again , however , Jehovah has used the congregation and the elders to con@@ fir@@ m his love for me .
I pray that I will never let him go . ”
If you turn to doing good , will you not be res@@ t@@ or@@ ed to fav@@ or ?
But if you do not turn to doing good , sin is cr@@ ou@@ ch@@ ing at the do@@ or , and its cr@@ av@@ ing is to dom@@ in@@ ate you ; but will you get the ma@@ st@@ ery over it ? ”

Like that p@@ ilo@@ t , Adam and Eve wanted to do things their own way .
He said : “ If you remain in my word , you are really my disciples , and you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free . ”
Why can the freedom that Jesus promised make us “ truly free ” ?

The apostle Paul promised : “ God is not un@@ righteous so as to for@@ get your work and the love you showed for his name . ”
You are never too young to set go@@ als .
Proverbs 21 : 5 says : “ The pl@@ ans of the di@@ li@@ g@@ ent su@@ rely lead to succ@@ ess . ”

17 , 18 . ( a ) What does Jehovah want for young people today ?
I was born in a one - ro@@ om lo@@ g c@@ ab@@ in in a very small to@@ wn called L@@ ib@@ er@@ ty , In@@ di@@ ana , U@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ A .
Later , my mother gave bir@@ th to my two you@@ ng@@ er brothers and my you@@ ng@@ er sister .
D@@ U@@ R@@ ING my school years , not much changed .
The to@@ wn of L@@ ib@@ er@@ ty was sur@@ r@@ ound@@ ed by small f@@ ar@@ ms , and the bas@@ ic cro@@ p was cor@@ n .
She took us to the B@@ ap@@ t@@ ist ch@@ urch every S@@ und@@ ay .
They wanted me to make the mil@@ it@@ ary my care@@ er .
This time , however , they inv@@ ited me to come to a C@@ ongreg@@ ation Bo@@ ok S@@ tu@@ dy , a small meeting for Bible study and discus@@ sion that was hel@@ d in their home .
I told them I would think about it .
I co@@ ul@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t believe how much they knew about the Bible !
Y@@ ears before , when I asked my mother about Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , she simply said , “ O@@ h , they worship some old man named Jehovah . ”
But I now felt that my eyes were being op@@ ened !
I started pione@@ ering the next year , in 19@@ 5@@ 8 .
G@@ l@@ or@@ ia was a j@@ e@@ w@@ el then , and she is a j@@ e@@ w@@ el today .
G@@ l@@ or@@ ia and I got married in F@@ e@@ br@@ u@@ ary of 19@@ 5@@ 9 .
A de@@ ar brother , Sim@@ on K@@ ra@@ k@@ er , inter@@ vie@@ wed us .
He told us that Bethel was not accep@@ ting married cou@@ ples at that time .
Most of our jo@@ bs pa@@ id three d@@ ol@@ lar@@ s a day .
E@@ ach we@@ ek , G@@ l@@ or@@ ia did ir@@ on@@ ing for one family .
I remember one time when we sto@@ pped at a g@@ as st@@ ation .
On the other hand , we had wonderful times with the brothers , and we loved our ministry !
Me@@ an@@ while , I started a study with the cou@@ ple@@ ’@@ s daughter and her husband .
M@@ other and daughter both decided to serve Jehovah and got baptized .
We had de@@ ar friends in the wh@@ ite congregation .
The K@@ u K@@ lu@@ x K@@ l@@ an ( K@@ K@@ K ) , an organization that prom@@ ot@@ es rac@@ ism and viol@@ ence , was very ac@@ tive then .
In 19@@ 6@@ 2 , I was inv@@ ited to atten@@ d the Kingdom M@@ in@@ is@@ try S@@ chool at S@@ ou@@ th L@@ ans@@ ing , New Y@@ or@@ k .
However , a t@@ ele@@ ph@@ one comp@@ any in P@@ ine B@@ lu@@ f@@ f had inter@@ vie@@ wed me for a jo@@ b .
If they hi@@ red me , I would be the first bl@@ ack man to work for that comp@@ any .
I had no money to trav@@ el to New Y@@ or@@ k .
She said , “ G@@ o to school and learn as much as you can , and come back and teach us ! ”
I am so gl@@ ad that I did not take that jo@@ b !
H@@ ere is how G@@ l@@ or@@ ia re@@ members our time in P@@ ine B@@ lu@@ f@@ f : “ I f@@ ell in love with the ter@@ rit@@ ory !
So we would go in the house - to - house work in the mor@@ ning and then conduct Bible stu@@ dies the rest of the day , som@@ etimes until 11 o@@ ’@@ clo@@ ck at night .
While we were pione@@ ering in P@@ ine B@@ lu@@ f@@ f , we app@@ lied to become special pione@@ ers .
Bro@@ ther Le@@ on W@@ e@@ av@@ er , now the co@@ or@@ din@@ at@@ or of the Un@@ ited St@@ ates B@@ ran@@ ch Com@@ mit@@ te@@ e , was appointed to serve as a circu@@ it overse@@ er at the same time .
I was n@@ er@@ v@@ ous about becom@@ ing a circu@@ it overse@@ er .
After I was appointed , Bro@@ ther Tho@@ m@@ p@@ son was the first dist@@ ri@@ c@@ t overse@@ er I served with .
In those days , a circu@@ it overse@@ er received little tra@@ ining .
I remember saying to G@@ l@@ or@@ ia , “ Does he really have to leave now ? ”
One time , the K@@ K@@ K hel@@ d a mar@@ ch in a to@@ wn we were vis@@ iting in T@@ en@@ n@@ es@@ see .
The following mon@@ th , we began our Bethel service .
G@@ l@@ or@@ ia was a j@@ e@@ w@@ el when I married her , and she still is
Then in 199@@ 9 , I was appointed to be a member of the G@@ over@@ ning Bo@@ dy .
Isaiah 32 : 17 says : “ The result of true righteousness will be peace , and the fru@@ it@@ age of true righteousness will be lasting tr@@ an@@ qu@@ il@@ l@@ ity and sec@@ ur@@ ity . ”
S@@ ec@@ ond , we must pray for G@@ od@@ ’@@ s holy spirit .
If the house is des@@ er@@ ving , let the peace you wish it come upon it ; but if it is not des@@ er@@ ving , let the peace from you return upon you . ”
So I gre@@ e@@ ted her in her own tong@@ ue .
T@@ ak@@ en by sur@@ pris@@ e , she asked me , ‘ What is the reason for your vis@@ it ? ’
I pol@@ it@@ ely told her that I wis@@ h@@ ed to see the H@@ i@@ gh Com@@ mis@@ sion@@ er .
She t@@ ele@@ ph@@ oned the of@@ fici@@ al , who came out to meet me and gre@@ e@@ ted me in the lo@@ cal language .
After that , he carefully listen@@ ed to me as I explained to him the pe@@ ac@@ eful activ@@ ities of the Witnesses . ”
