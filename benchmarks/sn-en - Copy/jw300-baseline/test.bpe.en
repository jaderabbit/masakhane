This magaz@@ ine has been publ@@ ished continu@@ ously since 18@@ 7@@ 9 and is n@@ on@@ pol@@ itical .
It ad@@ her@@ es to the Bible as its authority .
Be@@ be had been very close to her father .
The re@@ mar@@ k came from a well - meaning family friend , but Be@@ be found it more c@@ ut@@ ting than com@@ for@@ ting .
“ His death w@@ as@@ n@@ ’@@ t for the best , ” she kept re@@ pe@@ ating to her@@ self .
It was clear that when Be@@ be rec@@ oun@@ ted the inc@@ ident in a book years later , she was still g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing .
As Be@@ be came to see , it can take a long time for someone to over@@ come g@@ ri@@ ef , especially when the ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed person was very close to the dec@@ eas@@ ed .
In the Bible , death is ap@@ tly describ@@ ed as “ the last enem@@ y . ”
It bre@@ ak@@ s into our lives with ir@@ res@@ is@@ ti@@ ble for@@ ce , often when we are compl@@ et@@ ely un@@ prepar@@ ed , and it ro@@ bs us of those we hold de@@ ar .
N@@ one of us are im@@ mune to its ra@@ va@@ ges .
So it is not sur@@ pris@@ ing if we feel at a l@@ oss when it comes to cop@@ ing with death and its af@@ ter@@ mat@@ h .
Per@@ haps you have wond@@ ered : ‘ How long does it take to get over g@@ ri@@ ef ?
How can I com@@ fort others who have been ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed ?
Is there any hope for our loved ones who have died ? ’
H@@ ave you ever had a b@@ ri@@ ef b@@ out with ill@@ ness ?
As an example , consider how the pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch Abraham re@@ ac@@ ted when his wife died .
The Bible says that “ Abraham began to mo@@ ur@@ n and to we@@ ep over S@@ ar@@ ah . ”
The expres@@ sion “ began to ” su@@ gg@@ ests that it took some time for him to c@@ ope with his l@@ oss .
He g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ed for “ many days , ” and his family members were un@@ able to com@@ fort him .
S@@ ever@@ al years later , the death of Joseph still we@@ igh@@ ed heav@@ ily on his mind . ​ — Genesis 23 : 2 ; 37 : 34 , 35 ; 42 : 36 ; 45 : 28 .
“ My husband , R@@ ob@@ er@@ t , died on J@@ u@@ ly 9 , 200@@ 8 .
S@@ i@@ x years later the pain in my heart is still there .
I d@@ on@@ ’@@ t think I will ever get over my l@@ oss of R@@ o@@ b . ” ​ — G@@ ai@@ l , ag@@ ed 60 .
“ Although I have been without my de@@ ar wife for more than 18 years , I still mis@@ s her and g@@ ri@@ eve over my l@@ oss .
Wh@@ en@@ ever I see something in n@@ ature that is at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive , my th@@ ough@@ ts go to her , and I cannot help wond@@ ering how she would have enjo@@ yed se@@ e@@ ing what I am se@@ e@@ ing . ” ​ — E@@ ti@@ en@@ ne , ag@@ ed 8@@ 4 .
C@@ learly , such pa@@ in@@ ful and long - lasting feelings are only n@@ atur@@ al .
E@@ ach person g@@ ri@@ ev@@ es in his or her own way , and it would be un@@ wise to jud@@ ge the way another person respon@@ ds to tr@@ ag@@ ed@@ y .
At the same time , we may need to hold off from con@@ dem@@ ning ourselves if our re@@ action to l@@ oss se@@ ems exc@@ es@@ sive .
As we no@@ te in the “ I@@ mit@@ ate Their F@@ a@@ ith ” article in this is@@ sue , Isa@@ a@@ c was still g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing over the l@@ oss of his mother , S@@ ar@@ ah , three years after her death . ​ — Genesis 24 : 6@@ 7 .
For inst@@ ance , you may find that some will ad@@ v@@ ise you not to cr@@ y or show your feelings in any way .
O@@ thers may p@@ us@@ h you to do the op@@ pos@@ ite and ex@@ pose all your feelings .
The Bible pres@@ ents a more b@@ al@@ anc@@ ed view , one that is sup@@ por@@ ted by moder@@ n res@@ ear@@ ch .
In some cul@@ tur@@ es it is consid@@ ered un@@ man@@ ly for a m@@ ale to cr@@ y .
But is there a real need to feel as@@ ham@@ ed about sh@@ ed@@ ding te@@ ars , even in public ?
M@@ ental - health ex@@ per@@ ts ac@@ knowledge that te@@ ar@@ ful@@ ness is a nor@@ ma@@ l part of g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing .
And g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing may , in time , help you to move on des@@ pite the en@@ or@@ m@@ ity of your l@@ oss .
S@@ up@@ pres@@ sing g@@ ri@@ ef , however , may do more har@@ m than good .
The Bible l@@ ends no support to the no@@ tion that it is wrong or un@@ man@@ ly to sh@@ ed te@@ ars of g@@ ri@@ ef .
At the death of his de@@ ar friend L@@ az@@ ar@@ us , Jesus op@@ enly we@@ p@@ t , even though he had the power to bring the dead back to life ! ​ — John 11 : 33 - 35 .
B@@ ou@@ ts of anger are often part of g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing , especially in cas@@ es of s@@ ud@@ den , un@@ expec@@ ted death .
There are many reas@@ ons why a ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed person may feel ang@@ ry , such as when th@@ ough@@ t@@ less and un@@ f@@ ound@@ ed comm@@ ents are made by a resp@@ ected person .
“ I was only 14 years old when my father died , ” explain@@ s a South Afr@@ ican man nam@@ ed M@@ ike .
“ At the fun@@ er@@ al , the A@@ ng@@ l@@ ican minis@@ ter said that God needs good people and takes them early .
* This ang@@ ered me because we des@@ per@@ ately needed our father .
E@@ spec@@ ially in the case of un@@ expec@@ ted death , the ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed person may re@@ pe@@ at@@ edly think , ‘ It might not have happ@@ ened if only I had done this or that . ’
If you are being pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed by such feelings of gu@@ il@@ t and anger , it is important not to b@@ ot@@ tle up these emo@@ tions .
Rather , speak to a friend who will list@@ en and reas@@ sure you that such ir@@ r@@ ational feelings are common to many ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed ones .
The Bible rem@@ ind@@ s us : “ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of distr@@ ess . ” ​ — Proverbs 17 : 17 .
The best F@@ ri@@ end a ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed person can have is our Creator , Jehovah God .
P@@ our out your heart to him in prayer because “ he car@@ es for you . ”
M@@ ore@@ over , he prom@@ ises that all who do so will have their th@@ ough@@ ts and feelings so@@ o@@ th@@ ed by “ the peace of God that sur@@ pas@@ ses all understanding . ”
Al@@ so , al@@ low God to help you he@@ al by means of his cons@@ ol@@ ing Word , the Bible .
H@@ av@@ ing such th@@ ough@@ ts to p@@ ond@@ er over may be especially help@@ ful at night when you are alone and find it hard to s@@ le@@ ep . ​ — Isaiah 5@@ 7 : 15 .
R@@ ec@@ ently , a 40 - year - old man , whom we will c@@ all J@@ ack , lost his bel@@ o@@ ved wife to c@@ anc@@ er .
“ When I pray to Jehovah , ” he explain@@ s , “ I never feel alone .
I often wake up during the night and cannot get back to s@@ le@@ ep .
After reading and m@@ ed@@ it@@ ating on com@@ for@@ ting th@@ ough@@ ts from the Scriptures and then po@@ uring out the feelings of my heart in prayer , I sense a cal@@ m@@ ness and a trans@@ c@@ ending peace come over me , put@@ ting my mind and heart at res@@ t and en@@ ab@@ ling me to s@@ le@@ ep . ”
A young woman nam@@ ed Van@@ ess@@ a lost her mother to ill@@ ness .
She too has experi@@ enced the power of prayer .
“ In my most difficult times , ” she says , “ I would just c@@ all on God@@ ’@@ s name and bre@@ ak down in te@@ ars .
Jehovah list@@ ened to my pray@@ ers and always gave me the streng@@ th I needed . ”
Some ber@@ e@@ av@@ ement coun@@ sel@@ ors ad@@ v@@ ise those who are str@@ ug@@ gl@@ ing with g@@ ri@@ ef to get involved in help@@ ing others or to vol@@ un@@ te@@ er their time in some commun@@ ity service .
Do@@ ing so can bring joy and may e@@ ase a person@@ ’@@ s g@@ ri@@ ef .
Many ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed Christians have found that working to help others has brought them great com@@ fort . ​ — 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 .
God feel@@ s for you in your pain . ​ — Psalm 5@@ 5 : 22 ; 1 Peter 5 : 7 .
God pati@@ ently list@@ ens to the pray@@ ers of his servants . ​ — Psalm 8@@ 6 : 5 ; 1 Th@@ ess@@ al@@ on@@ ians 5 : 17 .
God mis@@ ses people who have died . ​ — Job 14 : 13 - 15 .
God prom@@ ises to resurrec@@ t the dead . ​ — Isaiah 26 : 19 ; John 5 : 28 , 29 .
H@@ ave you ever felt hel@@ pl@@ ess when someone near to you was g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing over the l@@ oss of a loved one ?
S@@ om@@ etimes we may feel un@@ sure of what to say or do ​ — so we w@@ ind up saying and doing nothing .
But there are practic@@ al , help@@ ful things that we can do .
O@@ f@@ ten , all that is needed is your pres@@ ence along with a sim@@ ple expres@@ sion , such as “ I am so sor@@ ry . ”
In many cul@@ tur@@ es , giving the person a hu@@ g or a g@@ ent@@ le s@@ qu@@ e@@ ez@@ e of the ar@@ m is an eff@@ ective way to show you care .
If the ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed one wan@@ ts to talk , list@@ en sy@@ m@@ pa@@ the@@ tic@@ ally .
B@@ est of all , do something for the ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed family , perhaps per@@ form@@ ing a ch@@ ore the g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing one has not been able to care for , such as co@@ ok@@ ing a me@@ al , car@@ ing for the children , or help@@ ing with fun@@ er@@ al arrang@@ ements if that is desir@@ ed .
Such ac@@ tions may speak l@@ ou@@ der than the most el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent words .
In time , you may be moved to talk about the dec@@ eas@@ ed , perhaps fo@@ c@@ using on some good qual@@ ities or happy experi@@ ences .
Such con@@ vers@@ ation may even bring a sm@@ ile to the ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed person@@ ’@@ s face .
For example , Pa@@ m ​ — who lost her husband , I@@ an , si@@ x years ago — ​ says : “ Pe@@ ople som@@ etimes tell me good things that I@@ an did that I never knew about , and that makes my heart feel good . ”
R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers re@@ port that many ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed people receive a lo@@ t of in@@ iti@@ al help but that their needs are soon for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten as friends get bus@@ y again with their own lives .
Th@@ er@@ efore , make a point of cont@@ ac@@ ting a ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed friend on a reg@@ ular bas@@ is after the l@@ oss .
* Many g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing ones de@@ ep@@ ly appreci@@ ate this opport@@ unity to reli@@ eve themselves of pro@@ long@@ ed feelings of g@@ ri@@ ef .
Consider the example of K@@ a@@ ori , a young Jap@@ an@@ ese woman who was dev@@ ast@@ ated by the l@@ oss of her mother follow@@ ed by the l@@ oss of her ol@@ der sis@@ ter 15 mon@@ ths later .
T@@ han@@ k@@ fully , she received ongo@@ ing support from loy@@ al friends .
One nam@@ ed R@@ its@@ uko is much ol@@ der than K@@ a@@ ori and offer@@ ed to be her close friend .
“ To be hon@@ est , ” says K@@ a@@ ori , “ I w@@ as@@ n@@ ’@@ t happy about that .
I di@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t want anyone to take the place of my mother , and I di@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t think that anyone could .
However , because of the way M@@ ama R@@ its@@ uko tre@@ ated me , I came to feel close to her .
E@@ very we@@ ek , we went out in the ev@@ ang@@ el@@ iz@@ ing work together and went to Christian meetings together .
She inv@@ ited me to have te@@ a with her , brought me me@@ als , and wrote me let@@ ters and car@@ ds many times .
M@@ ama R@@ its@@ uk@@ o@@ ’@@ s pos@@ itive attitude had a good influ@@ ence on me . ”
T@@ w@@ el@@ ve years have pas@@ sed since K@@ a@@ or@@ i@@ ’@@ s mother died , and today she and her husband are full - time ev@@ ang@@ el@@ iz@@ ers .
“ M@@ ama R@@ its@@ uko , ” K@@ a@@ ori says , “ continu@@ es to show her concer@@ n .
When I go back home , I always vis@@ it her and enjoy her up@@ build@@ ing associ@@ ation . ”
Ano@@ ther example of someone who benef@@ ited from ongo@@ ing support is P@@ ol@@ i , one of Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses in C@@ y@@ pr@@ us .
P@@ ol@@ i had a kind husband , So@@ zo@@ s , who set a good example as a Christian sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d by often inv@@ iting or@@ ph@@ ans and wid@@ o@@ ws to their home for associ@@ ation and a me@@ al .
S@@ ad@@ ly , at the age of 5@@ 3 , So@@ zo@@ s died of a b@@ ra@@ in t@@ um@@ or .
There , they began associ@@ ating with a congregation of Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
“ The friends in my new congregation , ” rec@@ all@@ s P@@ ol@@ i , “ did not know any@@ thing about our past and our difficult circum@@ stances .
But that did not sto@@ p them from appro@@ aching us and emb@@ r@@ ac@@ ing us with their kind words and practic@@ al help .
How preci@@ ous that help was , especially at that time , when my son needed his father most !
Those taking the lead in the congregation showed a great de@@ al of personal interest in Daniel .
One in partic@@ ular made sure to includ@@ e Daniel when enjo@@ ying associ@@ ation with friends or when going out to pl@@ ay b@@ all . ”
B@@ oth mother and son are doing well today .
To be sure , there are many ways we can off@@ er practic@@ al help and com@@ fort to those who mo@@ ur@@ n .
The Bible also com@@ forts us by means of a thr@@ ill@@ ing hope for the future .
Some have even mar@@ ked the d@@ ate of the death on their cal@@ end@@ ar as a rem@@ ind@@ er to off@@ er com@@ fort when it may be most needed ​ — on or near the d@@ ate of the l@@ oss .
You may rec@@ all that G@@ ai@@ l , mentioned ear@@ li@@ er in this ser@@ ies , doub@@ ts whether she will ever get over the death of her husband , R@@ o@@ b .
However , she is look@@ ing for@@ ward to se@@ e@@ ing him again in God@@ ’@@ s prom@@ ised new world .
My feelings really go out to people who have lost someone they love but who are not aw@@ are of this hope of se@@ e@@ ing their loved one again . ”
So@@ on , God will do just that ​ — for Job and coun@@ t@@ less others — ​ when this earth is trans@@ formed into a par@@ adise .
“ There is going to be a resurrection , ” the Bible con@@ fir@@ ms at Acts 24 : 15 .
“ Do not be am@@ az@@ ed at this , ” Jesus as@@ sur@@ es us , “ for the h@@ our is coming in which all those in the m@@ emor@@ ial t@@ omb@@ s will he@@ ar his vo@@ ice and come out . ”
He will have the pros@@ p@@ ect of reg@@ ain@@ ing “ his you@@ th@@ ful v@@ ig@@ or , ” and his fles@@ h will for@@ ever remain “ f@@ res@@ her than in you@@ th . ”
The same will happ@@ en to all who respon@@ d with appreci@@ ation to God@@ ’@@ s mer@@ ci@@ ful pro@@ vis@@ ion of a resurrection to life on earth .
If you have suffer@@ ed the l@@ oss of someone de@@ ar to you , the information we have discus@@ sed may not compl@@ et@@ ely take away your g@@ ri@@ ef .
But by m@@ ed@@ it@@ ating on God@@ ’@@ s prom@@ ises found in the Bible , you can find real hope and the streng@@ th to keep going . ​ — 1 Th@@ ess@@ al@@ on@@ ians 4 : 13 .
W@@ ould you like to learn more about how to c@@ ope with g@@ ri@@ ef ?
O@@ r do you have rel@@ ated questions , such as “ Why does God al@@ low evil and suffering ? ”
P@@ le@@ ase vis@@ it our we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , j@@ w@@ .@@ or@@ g , to see how the Bible gives com@@ for@@ ting , practic@@ al ans@@ wers .
“ God . . . will w@@ ip@@ e out every te@@ ar from their eyes , and death will be no more . ” ​ — Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 .
This is@@ sue of The Watchtower discus@@ ses how God will ful@@ f@@ ill that promise and what it can mean for you .
I told the off@@ ic@@ er that I had already been in pris@@ on because I would not f@@ ight .
I W@@ A@@ S born in 19@@ 26 in C@@ ro@@ ok@@ s@@ v@@ il@@ le , O@@ hi@@ o , in the United States .
Father and M@@ other were not religious , but they told us e@@ ight children to go to church .
Mar@@ gar@@ et W@@ al@@ k@@ er ( second sis@@ ter from the left ) helped me learn the truth
Ab@@ out that time , a neigh@@ b@@ or nam@@ ed Mar@@ gar@@ et W@@ al@@ k@@ er , one of Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , began vis@@ iting my mother and tal@@ king to her about the Bible .
But I kept tr@@ ying to list@@ en to their discus@@ sions .
After a cou@@ ple more vis@@ its , Mar@@ gar@@ et asked me , “ Do you know what God@@ ’@@ s name is ? ”
I said , “ E@@ ver@@ y@@ one kno@@ ws that ​ — it@@ ’@@ s God . ”
She said , “ G@@ et your Bible and look up Psalm 8@@ 3 : 18 . ”
I did , and I dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ed that God@@ ’@@ s name is Jehovah .
I r@@ an out to my friends and told them , “ When you get home t@@ on@@ ight , look up Psalm 8@@ 3 : 18 in the Bible and see what God@@ ’@@ s name is . ”
You might say I started wit@@ nes@@ sing right away .
I stu@@ died the Bible and got baptized in 19@@ 41 .
So@@ on af@@ ter@@ ward , I was as@@ sig@@ ned to conduct a congregation book study .
I encourag@@ ed my mother and s@@ ib@@ l@@ ings to come , and they all began att@@ ending the book study that I conduc@@ ted .
S@@ om@@ etimes when she was on her way , he ch@@ as@@ ed after her and p@@ ul@@ led her back into the house .
But she would just ru@@ n out the other do@@ or and go to the meet@@ ing .
I also told the off@@ ic@@ ials that I would not become a sol@@ di@@ er .
In cour@@ t two we@@ ek@@ s later , the jud@@ ge said : “ If it were up to me , I@@ ’@@ d give you a life s@@ ent@@ ence .
I rep@@ li@@ ed : “ Your H@@ on@@ or , I should have been cl@@ as@@ si@@ f@@ ied as a minis@@ ter .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one@@ ’@@ s do@@ or@@ st@@ ep is my p@@ ul@@ p@@ it , and I have pre@@ ached the good news of the Kingdom to many people . ”
The jud@@ ge told the j@@ ur@@ y : “ You are not here to dec@@ ide whether this young man is a minis@@ ter or not .
You are here to dec@@ ide whether he repor@@ ted for ind@@ uc@@ tion into the ar@@ my or not . ”
I pray@@ ed to Jehovah : “ I cannot st@@ ay in a c@@ ell for f@@ ive years .
The next day , the gu@@ ards let me out .
I wal@@ ked over to a t@@ all , bro@@ ad - sh@@ ou@@ ld@@ ered pris@@ on@@ er , and we sto@@ od there look@@ ing out a win@@ do@@ w .
He asked me , “ What are you in for , S@@ hor@@ ty ? ”
I said , “ I am one of Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses . ”
I said , “ Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses d@@ on@@ ’@@ t go to war and k@@ ill people . ”
I said , “ No , it do@@ es@@ n@@ ’@@ t . ”
Then he said , “ For 15 years I was in another pris@@ on , where I read some of your liter@@ ature . ”
I was among the Witnesses im@@ pris@@ oned for ne@@ u@@ tr@@ ality at A@@ sh@@ land , K@@ ent@@ uc@@ k@@ y
That is how we pre@@ ached in an organ@@ ized way .
I wor@@ ri@@ ed about my family because D@@ ad had told me , “ If I can get ri@@ d of you , I can hand@@ le the res@@ t . ”
After my re@@ le@@ ase , I had a pleas@@ ant sur@@ pris@@ e .
I said , “ Th@@ at@@ ’@@ s fine , but I am not going into the ar@@ my . ”
I qu@@ ot@@ ed 2 Timothy 2 : 3 and said , “ I am already a sol@@ di@@ er of Christ . ”
After a long s@@ il@@ ence , he said , “ You can leave . ”
So@@ on af@@ ter@@ ward , I att@@ ended the Be@@ the@@ l meet@@ ing at a conven@@ tion in C@@ inc@@ in@@ n@@ ati , O@@ hi@@ o .
I also wor@@ ked at As@@ s@@ emb@@ ly H@@ all@@ s in New York C@@ ity .
I have made many friends at Be@@ the@@ l and in the congregation .
I have learned a little M@@ and@@ ar@@ in Chin@@ ese and enjoy appro@@ aching Chin@@ ese people on the st@@ re@@ et .
Some mor@@ n@@ ings I place 30 or 40 magaz@@ ines with inter@@ ested ones .
P@@ re@@ aching to the Chin@@ ese people in Bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n , New York
I have even made a return vis@@ it in Ch@@ ina !
She took them and told me that her name was K@@ ati@@ e .
After that , wh@@ en@@ ever she saw me , K@@ ati@@ e came over to talk to me .
I taught her the nam@@ es of fru@@ its and ve@@ g@@ et@@ ab@@ les in Eng@@ l@@ ish , and she re@@ pe@@ ated the words after me .
I also explain@@ ed Bible t@@ ex@@ ts to her , and she accep@@ ted the Bible T@@ each book .
After some we@@ ek@@ s , though , she dis@@ appe@@ ared .
The next we@@ ek , she hand@@ ed me her c@@ ell ph@@ one and said , “ You talk to Ch@@ ina . ”
I said , “ I d@@ on@@ ’@@ t know any@@ body in Ch@@ ina . ”
But she in@@ sis@@ ted , so I took the ph@@ one and said , “ H@@ ell@@ o , this is R@@ ob@@ is@@ on . ”
The vo@@ ice at the other end said , “ R@@ ob@@ by , this is K@@ ati@@ e .
P@@ le@@ ase teach her the way you taught me . ”
I said , “ K@@ ati@@ e , I will do the best I can .
T@@ han@@ ks for let@@ ting me know where you are . ”
So@@ on af@@ ter@@ ward , I spok@@ e to K@@ ati@@ e@@ ’@@ s sis@@ ter for the last time .
If it is God@@ ’@@ s will , my family members and friends who have died will return to life in the new world .

TH@@ IN@@ K about the happ@@ i@@ est day of your life .
W@@ as it when you got married or when your first child was born ?
Ver@@ y likely , you have experi@@ enced much joy in serving Jehovah since your bap@@ tis@@ m .
What reas@@ ons do we have for continu@@ ing to serve Jehovah with joy ?
R@@ em@@ ember that Jesus said : “ C@@ ome to me , all you who are to@@ il@@ ing and lo@@ ad@@ ed down , and I will ref@@ res@@ h you .
T@@ ake my yo@@ k@@ e upon you and learn from me , for I am m@@ ild - tem@@ per@@ ed and low@@ ly in heart , and you will find ref@@ res@@ h@@ ment for your@@ selves .
We serve our Li@@ fe - G@@ iver , the happy God .
Consider H@@ é@@ c@@ tor , who served Jehovah as a trav@@ el@@ ing overse@@ er for 40 years .
He says : “ Although it is sa@@ d to see my wi@@ fe@@ ’@@ s health gra@@ d@@ ually deter@@ i@@ or@@ ate and it has been chall@@ eng@@ ing to care for her , I have not al@@ low@@ ed this to ro@@ b me of my joy in serving the true God .
K@@ no@@ wing that I o@@ we my life to Jehovah , who cre@@ ated man for a purpose , is reason en@@ ough to love him de@@ ep@@ ly and serve him who@@ le@@ hear@@ t@@ edly .
I str@@ ive to st@@ ay ac@@ tive in the preaching work , and I try to keep the Kingdom hope for@@ em@@ ost in my mind so as not to l@@ ose my joy . ”
Jehovah has provid@@ ed the ran@@ so@@ m sacrifice , making it possible for us to have a jo@@ y@@ ful life .
Inde@@ ed , “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - beg@@ ot@@ ten Son , so that every@@ one exerc@@ is@@ ing faith in him might not be destro@@ yed but have everlasting life . ”
Jes@@ ú@@ s sim@@ pli@@ f@@ ied his life and served Jehovah jo@@ y@@ fully for years
I did it just to make more money .
Then I learned about Jehovah and how he had given his de@@ ar Son for mankind .
I had an int@@ ense desire to serve him .
So I dedic@@ ated my life to Jehovah , and after having wor@@ ked for the compan@@ y for 28 years , I dec@@ ided to qu@@ it and take up the full - time ministry . ”
Do you rem@@ ember what your life was like before you came to know Jehovah ?
The apostle Paul rem@@ ind@@ ed Christians in R@@ ome that they “ were once the sl@@ av@@ es of sin ” but had become “ sl@@ av@@ es to righteousness . ”
“ The happ@@ i@@ est years of my life have been those sp@@ ent serving Jehovah . ” ​ — J@@ aim@@ e

In the sp@@ ring of 33 C.E . , Jesus the N@@ az@@ ar@@ ene was ex@@ ec@@ uted .
He had been fal@@ sel@@ y char@@ ged with se@@ d@@ ition , sa@@ vag@@ ely be@@ at@@ en , and na@@ iled to a st@@ ake .
But God ra@@ ised him back to life , and 40 days later , Jesus as@@ c@@ ended to heaven .
This ex@@ tr@@ a@@ ord@@ in@@ ary account comes to us from the four G@@ os@@ p@@ els of the Christian Greek Scriptures , comm@@ only called the New T@@ est@@ am@@ ent .
On the other hand , if those ev@@ ents really did happ@@ en , then there is a br@@ ight future for mankind , one in which you can share .
So , are the G@@ os@@ pe@@ l acc@@ oun@@ ts fact or f@@ ic@@ tion ?
Un@@ like fan@@ ci@@ ful leg@@ ends , the G@@ os@@ pe@@ l writ@@ ings refl@@ ect pa@@ inst@@ aking acc@@ ur@@ ac@@ y and attention to det@@ ai@@ l .
For example , they ab@@ ound with nam@@ es of real plac@@ es , many of which can be vis@@ ited today .
They tell about real people , who@@ se ex@@ ist@@ ence has been cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ated by sec@@ ular hist@@ or@@ ians . ​ — Luke 3 : 1 , 2 , 23 .
Jesus himself is mentioned by sec@@ ular writ@@ ers of the first and second centur@@ ies .
* His man@@ ner of death , as describ@@ ed in the G@@ os@@ p@@ els , ag@@ re@@ es with Roman ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ti@@ onal me@@ tho@@ ds of the time .
M@@ ore@@ over , ev@@ ents are rel@@ ated in a fac@@ t@@ ual and can@@ did man@@ ner ​ — even por@@ tr@@ ay@@ ing some of Jesus ’ disciples un@@ fav@@ or@@ ably .
All these fac@@ t@@ ors str@@ ong@@ ly indic@@ ate that the G@@ os@@ pe@@ l writ@@ ers were hon@@ est and acc@@ ur@@ ate in what they wrote about Jesus .
While it is gener@@ ally accep@@ ted that Jesus liv@@ ed and died , some would question his resurrection .
Even his apostles did not believe the in@@ iti@@ al re@@ port of his having re@@ turned to life .
All doub@@ t was re@@ moved , however , when they and other disciples saw the resurrec@@ ted Jesus on se@@ par@@ ate occas@@ ions .
In fact , in one case , there were more than 5@@ 00 e@@ ye@@ wit@@ nesses present . ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 6 .
At the ris@@ k of being ar@@ res@@ ted and k@@ ill@@ ed , the disciples courag@@ e@@ ously pro@@ claim@@ ed Jesus ’ resurrection to all ​ — even to the very ones who had ex@@ ec@@ uted him .
W@@ ould so many disciples have been so bo@@ ld if they were not ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely sure that Jesus had really been resurrec@@ ted ?
In fact , the re@@ ality of the resurrection of Jesus is the dr@@ iving for@@ ce be@@ h@@ ind the im@@ pa@@ c@@ t that Christi@@ an@@ ity has had on the world both then and now .
The G@@ os@@ pe@@ l acc@@ oun@@ ts of Jesus ’ death and resurrection be@@ ar all the necess@@ ary mar@@ ks of an au@@ th@@ enti@@ c hist@@ or@@ ical rec@@ ord .
C@@ are@@ fully reading them will con@@ v@@ in@@ ce you that these ev@@ ents really happ@@ ened .
Your con@@ vic@@ tion can be fur@@ ther streng@@ th@@ ened when you understand why they took place .
T@@ ac@@ it@@ us , born about 5@@ 5 C.E . , wrote that “ Christ@@ us , from whom the name [ Christians ] had its orig@@ in , suffer@@ ed the ext@@ re@@ me pen@@ al@@ ty during the re@@ ign of T@@ ib@@ er@@ i@@ us at the hand@@ s of one of our pro@@ cur@@ at@@ ors , P@@ on@@ ti@@ us P@@ il@@ at@@ us . ”
Jesus is also refer@@ red to by Su@@ et@@ on@@ i@@ us ( first century ) ; Jewish hist@@ or@@ ian Josep@@ h@@ us ( first century ) ; and P@@ l@@ in@@ y the Y@@ oun@@ g@@ er , gover@@ nor of B@@ i@@ th@@ y@@ n@@ ia ( early second century ) .
Then , too , it is un@@ likely that Jesus ’ many op@@ pos@@ ers would wr@@ ite any@@ thing that would l@@ end cre@@ di@@ b@@ ility to the repor@@ ts about him .
Re@@ gar@@ ding Jesus ’ resurrection , Peter , one of his apostles , explain@@ ed : “ God ra@@ ised this one up on the th@@ ir@@ d day and al@@ low@@ ed him to become man@@ if@@ est , not to all the people , but to wit@@ nesses appoin@@ ted be@@ for@@ e@@ hand by God , to us , who ate and d@@ ran@@ k with him after his ris@@ ing from the dead . ”
Matthe@@ w@@ ’@@ s G@@ os@@ pe@@ l tell@@ s us that when the religious enem@@ ies heard repor@@ ts of Jesus ’ resurrection , they s@@ chem@@ ed to sup@@ pres@@ s them . ​ — Matthew 28 : 11 - 15 .
Does this mean that Jesus wanted his resurrection to be kept se@@ cre@@ t ?
No , for Peter went on to say : “ He ord@@ ered us to pre@@ ach to the people and to give a thor@@ ough witness that this is the one dec@@ re@@ ed by God to be jud@@ ge of the living and the dead . ”
Tru@@ e Christians have done and are doing just that . ​ — Acts 10 : 42 .
“ Th@@ r@@ ough one man [ Adam ] sin ent@@ ered into the world and death through sin . ” ​ — Romans 5 : 12
What would you say if you were asked , “ Do you want to live for@@ ever ? ”
M@@ ost people would prob@@ ably say that they want to but that they feel it is un@@ real@@ is@@ tic to consider it .
De@@ ath is a nor@@ ma@@ l part of life , they say , the n@@ atur@@ al out@@ come of our ex@@ ist@@ ence .
S@@ up@@ pose , though , that the question were turned around and you were asked , “ Are you ready to die ? ”
U@@ nd@@ er nor@@ ma@@ l circum@@ stances , most people would answer no .
The Bible shows that God cre@@ ated humans with the desire and the will to live .
In fact , it says that “ he has even put et@@ ern@@ ity in their heart . ” ​ — Ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ ast@@ es 3 : 11 .
The re@@ ality , though , is that humans do not live for@@ ever .
F@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , has God done any@@ thing to rem@@ ed@@ y the situation ?
The Bib@@ le@@ ’@@ s ans@@ wers are hear@@ t@@ ening , and they have a dir@@ ect be@@ aring on why Jesus suffer@@ ed and died .
The first three chap@@ ters of the Bible book of Genesis tell us that God set before the first human cou@@ ple , Adam and E@@ ve , the pros@@ p@@ ect of un@@ ending life and told them what they would have to do to gain it .
Then the account describ@@ es how they fa@@ iled to obe@@ y God and lost that pros@@ p@@ ect .
The st@@ ory is told simply ​ — so simply that some are qu@@ ick to dis@@ mis@@ s it as fol@@ k@@ l@@ ore .
But Genesis , like the G@@ os@@ p@@ els , gives every indic@@ ation of being a fac@@ t@@ ual , hist@@ or@@ ical rec@@ ord .
What has been the result of Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s fa@@ il@@ ure to obe@@ y ?
The Bible ans@@ wers this way : “ Th@@ r@@ ough one man [ Adam ] sin ent@@ ered into the world and death through sin , and so death sp@@ read to all men because they had all sin@@ ned . ”
He thus lost the pros@@ p@@ ect of end@@ less life and ev@@ ent@@ ually died .
Be@@ ing his des@@ c@@ end@@ ants , we have in@@ her@@ ited his sin@@ ful cond@@ ition .
But has God done any@@ thing to rem@@ ed@@ y the situation ?
Yes , God made arrang@@ ements to re@@ de@@ em , or bu@@ y back , what Adam had lost for his des@@ c@@ end@@ ants , nam@@ ely , the pros@@ p@@ ect of end@@ less life .
“ The wa@@ ges sin pa@@ ys is death , ” says the Bible at Romans 6 : 23 .
This means that death is the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of sin .
L@@ ik@@ e@@ wise , we sin and are therefore sub@@ ject to sin@@ ’@@ s wa@@ ges , death .
But we were born in this sin@@ ful cond@@ ition through no fa@@ ult of our own .
So God lov@@ ingly sent his Son , Jesus , to accept ‘ the wa@@ ges of sin ’ for us .
Jesus ’ death op@@ ens the way to a happy , end@@ less life
Since one man , the perfect man Adam , brought sin and death on us through dis@@ obedi@@ ence , a perfect man obedi@@ ent even till death was needed to re@@ le@@ ase us from that bur@@ den .
The Bible explain@@ s it this way : “ J@@ ust as through the dis@@ obedi@@ ence of the one man many were made sin@@ n@@ ers , so also through the obedi@@ ence of the one person many will be made righteous . ”
He left heaven , became a perfect man * , and died in our be@@ half .
As a result , it is possible for us to have a righteous standing with God and gain the pros@@ p@@ ect of end@@ less life .
Why , though , was it necess@@ ary for Jesus to die to ac@@ compl@@ ish this ?
C@@ ould not Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty God have simply is@@ su@@ ed a dec@@ ree that Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s des@@ c@@ end@@ ants be al@@ low@@ ed to live for@@ ever ?
H@@ ad God set jus@@ tice as@@ ide in this inst@@ ance , people might have wond@@ ered whether he would do so in other matters as well .
For example , would he be fai@@ r in determin@@ ing who among Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s off@@ sp@@ ring qual@@ if@@ y for et@@ ern@@ al life ?
C@@ ould he be tr@@ us@@ ted to keep his prom@@ ises ?
God@@ ’@@ s ad@@ her@@ ence to jus@@ tice in working out our sal@@ vation is as@@ sur@@ ance to us that he will always do what is right .
By Jesus ’ sacrif@@ ic@@ ial death , God op@@ ened the way to end@@ less life in Par@@ adise on earth .
N@@ ote Jesus ’ words as rec@@ ord@@ ed at John 3 : 16 : “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - beg@@ ot@@ ten Son , so that every@@ one exerc@@ is@@ ing faith in him might not be destro@@ yed but have everlasting life . ”
Jesus ’ death is thus an expres@@ sion not only of God@@ ’@@ s un@@ fa@@ il@@ ing jus@@ tice but , more spec@@ ially , of his great love for humans .
However , why did Jesus have to su@@ ff@@ er and die in the pa@@ in@@ ful way that was describ@@ ed in the G@@ os@@ p@@ els ?
By sub@@ j@@ ec@@ ting himself to the ext@@ re@@ me t@@ est and remain@@ ing faithful , Jesus ref@@ uted once and for all the D@@ ev@@ il@@ ’@@ s cl@@ ai@@ m that humans would not remain loy@@ al to God when under tr@@ ial .
That cl@@ ai@@ m might have se@@ em@@ ed va@@ li@@ d after Satan ind@@ uc@@ ed perfect Adam to sin .
But Jesus ​ — who was Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s perfect equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent — ​ remain@@ ed obedi@@ ent des@@ pite se@@ v@@ ere suffering .
He thus proved that Adam too could have obe@@ yed God if he had ch@@ os@@ en to do so .
By end@@ uring under tr@@ ial , Jesus left us a mo@@ de@@ l to follow .
God re@@ war@@ ded his S@@ on@@ ’@@ s perfect obedi@@ ence , gr@@ an@@ ting Jesus im@@ mor@@ t@@ al life in heaven .
Jesus indic@@ ated what we need to do when he said : “ This means everlasting life , their coming to know you , the only true God , and the one whom you sent , Jesus Christ . ” ​ — John 17 : 3 .

[ 1 ] ( par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h 14 ) See chap@@ ter 21 of the book God@@ ’@@ s Kingdom R@@ ul@@ es !
During an ass@@ emb@@ ly , a brother asked me if I would like to pre@@ ach .
We went to the ter@@ rit@@ ory , and he gave me some book@@ l@@ ets about God@@ ’@@ s Kingdom .
One of the s@@ isters there gave us children Bible less@@ ons based on the Bible and the book The H@@ ar@@ p of God .
As a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er , I enjo@@ yed giving people hope from God@@ ’@@ s Word .
The brother st@@ op@@ ped his b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le and asked me to s@@ it down with him on a lo@@ g .
He said : “ Who gave you authority to jud@@ ge who is a go@@ at ?
L@@ et@@ ’@@ s just be happy giving people the good news and leave the judg@@ ing to Jehovah . ”
Ano@@ ther ol@@ der brother taught me that to find happiness in giving , we som@@ etimes have to end@@ ure pati@@ ently .
Y@@ ear@@ s later , his pati@@ ence was re@@ war@@ ded when his wife was baptized as one of Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
After the war , I pione@@ ered for two years in sou@@ ther@@ n I@@ rel@@ and .
We did not real@@ ize how much power the pri@@ ests had .
I had never sa@@ iled before , so I was exc@@ ited .
For f@@ ive years , we pre@@ ached main@@ ly on is@@ ol@@ ated is@@ lands where there were no Witnesses .
The cre@@ w of mission@@ ar@@ ies ab@@ o@@ ard the S@@ ib@@ ia ( left to right ) : R@@ on Par@@ k@@ in , D@@ ick R@@ y@@ de , G@@ ust Mak@@ i , and St@@ an@@ le@@ y C@@ ar@@ ter
O@@ f@@ ten , they gave us f@@ res@@ h f@@ ish , avo@@ c@@ ad@@ o@@ s , and pe@@ an@@ ut@@ s .
Then at d@@ us@@ k we ran@@ g the ship@@ ’@@ s bel@@ l .
It was lov@@ ely to see how ser@@ i@@ ously some of them took their as@@ sign@@ ment .
When we arr@@ ived , I me@@ t and f@@ ell in love with Ma@@ x@@ ine Bo@@ y@@ d , a be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful mission@@ ary sis@@ ter .
So I said to my@@ self , ‘ R@@ on@@ al@@ d , if you want this gir@@ l , you@@ ’@@ ve got to act qu@@ ick@@ ly . ’
After three we@@ ek@@ s I pro@@ posed , and after si@@ x we@@ ek@@ s we were married .
Ma@@ x@@ ine and I were as@@ sig@@ ned as mission@@ ar@@ ies to P@@ u@@ er@@ to R@@ ic@@ o , so I never went out on the new bo@@ at .
For example , in the v@@ ill@@ age of P@@ ot@@ al@@ a Pas@@ ti@@ l@@ l@@ o , there were two Witness famil@@ ies with many children , and I used to pl@@ ay the fl@@ ute for them .
I asked one of the little gir@@ ls , H@@ il@@ da , if she wanted to come and pre@@ ach with us .
We b@@ ought her a pa@@ ir , and she came preaching with us .
She was about to leave for her as@@ sign@@ ment in Ec@@ u@@ ad@@ or , and she said : “ You d@@ on@@ ’@@ t recogn@@ ize me , do you ?
I am the little gir@@ l from Pas@@ ti@@ l@@ l@@ o who had no sho@@ es . ”
At first , L@@ en@@ n@@ ar@@ t Joh@@ n@@ son and I did most of the work .
Na@@ than K@@ nor@@ r , who was then taking the lead among Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , came to P@@ u@@ er@@ to R@@ ic@@ o .
L@@ ater , he gave me strong counsel about being organ@@ ized and said that he was dis@@ appoin@@ ted in me .
Father did not accept the truth when M@@ other and I did .
My de@@ ar wife , Ma@@ x@@ ine , died in 20@@ 11 .
I am really look@@ ing for@@ ward to se@@ e@@ ing her again in the resurrection .
After 60 years on the is@@ land , I felt as P@@ u@@ er@@ to R@@ ican as a co@@ qu@@ í , the pop@@ ular little P@@ u@@ er@@ to R@@ ican t@@ ree f@@ ro@@ g that s@@ ings ko - ke@@ e , ko - ke@@ e at d@@ us@@ k .
Some who come to see me want to discus@@ s personal or family problems .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing we do at Be@@ the@@ l is sac@@ red service .
Wh@@ er@@ ever we serve Jehovah , we have opport@@ un@@ ities to pra@@ ise him .

So@@ on after , our first daugh@@ ter , K@@ imb@@ er@@ ly , was born , and 17 mon@@ ths later , we had St@@ ep@@ han@@ y .
We would also go cam@@ p@@ ing with them and would have very enjo@@ y@@ able con@@ vers@@ ations around the cam@@ pf@@ ire .
We arrang@@ ed to have some who were in the full - time ministry st@@ ay in our home .
They were sho@@ c@@ ked and started to cr@@ y and said that they wanted to study .
With the help and dir@@ ection of God@@ ’@@ s organization , we did our best to ra@@ ise them to love Jehovah .
On a later tr@@ ip , K@@ imb@@ er@@ ly me@@ t one of his work@@ mat@@ es , B@@ ri@@ an L@@ le@@ well@@ y@@ n .
So they did st@@ ay free until they were at le@@ ast 23 .
At the same time , B@@ ri@@ an and K@@ imb@@ er@@ ly were inv@@ ited to work at L@@ ond@@ on Be@@ the@@ l and later were trans@@ f@@ er@@ red to M@@ al@@ a@@ wi Be@@ the@@ l .
The day after we left for the Watchtower E@@ duc@@ ational C@@ ent@@ er in P@@ at@@ ter@@ son , L@@ inda called to tell us that M@@ other had died .
N@@ ext , we taught the course in Z@@ imb@@ ab@@ we and then in Z@@ amb@@ ia .
In 200@@ 6 , B@@ ri@@ an and K@@ imb@@ er@@ ly moved next do@@ or to us to ra@@ ise their two daugh@@ ters , M@@ ac@@ k@@ enz@@ i@@ e and E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ et@@ h .

Are you among those who are lear@@ ning another language ?
( Read Ne@@ hem@@ iah 13 : 23 , 24 . )
( b ) How can we re@@ ach our go@@ al ?
We must recogn@@ ize that when we pre@@ pare for the ministry , for the meetings , or for a talk , we may not necess@@ ar@@ ily ap@@ ply what we read to ourselves .
Since my mind is main@@ ly involved in an int@@ ell@@ ec@@ t@@ ual exerc@@ ise , my heart is not necess@@ ar@@ ily t@@ ou@@ ched by the spiritual th@@ ough@@ ts I am reading .
That is why I reg@@ ularly set as@@ ide time to study the Bible and other publ@@ ic@@ ations in my mother t@@ ong@@ ue . ”
“ It an@@ no@@ yed him to go out in the ministry in another language , wh@@ ere@@ as before he loved preaching in his n@@ ative language , Fr@@ en@@ ch , ” says Mur@@ iel .
“ When we real@@ ized that this situation had h@@ ind@@ ered our son from making spiritual advan@@ c@@ ement , ” explain@@ s Ser@@ ge , “ we dec@@ ided to move back to our form@@ er congregation . ”
M@@ ake sure that the truth re@@ ach@@ es the hear@@ ts of your children ( See par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h@@ s 14 , 15 )
But we also includ@@ e prac@@ tice s@@ es@@ sions and g@@ ames in L@@ ing@@ al@@ a so that they can learn this language while having fu@@ n . ”

O@@ thers , like E@@ li@@ j@@ ah , “ wand@@ ered about in des@@ er@@ ts and m@@ oun@@ tain@@ s and c@@ av@@ es and d@@ ens of the earth . ”
How does No@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s example help us to understand what it means to have faith ?
In what ways must we exerc@@ ise our faith ?
In what two ways does Hebrews 11 : 1 describ@@ e faith ?
You see that his faith was ac@@ tive along with his works and his faith was perf@@ ected by his works . ”
For example , John explain@@ ed : “ The one who exerc@@ ises faith in the Son has everlasting life ; the one who dis@@ obe@@ ys the Son will not see life , but the wr@@ ath of God remain@@ s upon him . ”
Com@@ par@@ ed with love , how important is faith ?
James asked his anointed brothers : “ D@@ id not God cho@@ ose those who are po@@ or from the world@@ ’@@ s stand@@ point to be r@@ ich in faith and he@@ ir@@ s of the Kingdom , which he prom@@ ised to those who love him ? ”
While men were s@@ le@@ ep@@ ing , his enem@@ y came and over@@ so@@ wed we@@ ed@@ s in among the whe@@ at and left .
When the st@@ al@@ k sp@@ r@@ ou@@ ted and produc@@ ed fru@@ it , then the we@@ ed@@ s also appe@@ ared . ”
What hope did Jehovah give his people , and why was this promise re@@ mar@@ k@@ able ?
W@@ ould the Israelites ever again be able to worship God in a compl@@ et@@ ely accep@@ table way ?
So it does not really se@@ em that Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s people ent@@ ered into cap@@ tiv@@ ity to Babyl@@ on the Gre@@ at in 19@@ 18 .
( Read 1 Peter 2 : 9 , 10 . )
( Read Matthew 13 : 24 , 25 , 37 - 39 . )
W@@ ould true Christians ever be free to worship God op@@ enly and accep@@ t@@ ably ?

“ If you have any word of encourag@@ ement for the people , tell it . ” ​ — A@@ C@@ T@@ S 13 : 15 .

He also rem@@ ind@@ ed me of Jesus ’ words ​ — that each of us is wor@@ th more than many s@@ par@@ ro@@ ws .

What can we learn from the way Jehovah , Jesus , and Paul encourag@@ ed others ?
( Read Ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ ast@@ es 4 : 9 , 10 . )
What can we learn from the way Jesus tre@@ ated his apostles ?
After going through those reg@@ ions and giving many words of encourag@@ ement to the ones there , he arr@@ ived in Gre@@ ec@@ e . ”

There are many reas@@ ons why we should be th@@ an@@ k@@ ful to Jehovah !
It also shows how the hope of a re@@ ward benef@@ its us .
I was only e@@ ight years old at the time .
My father did not want my mother to talk to me about what she was lear@@ ning .
However , I was cur@@ ious and asked questions , so she stu@@ died with me when my father was out of the house .
As a result , I too dec@@ ided that I wanted to dedic@@ ate my life to Jehovah .
My mother said that I should first speak to the servan@@ t to the bre@@ th@@ ren ( now called a circ@@ u@@ it overse@@ er ) .
He said , “ G@@ o for it ! ”
After four mon@@ ths , I sel@@ ected a brother as my pione@@ er par@@ t@@ ner .
My mother pione@@ ered with a sis@@ ter in another congregation .
In 195@@ 1 , I fill@@ ed out an ap@@ pl@@ ication to att@@ end the Watchtower Bible S@@ chool of G@@ il@@ ead .
While there , I received my inv@@ it@@ ation to the 2@@ 2@@ n@@ d cl@@ ass of G@@ il@@ ead .

How can the congregation help you to re@@ du@@ ce an@@ x@@ i@@ ety ?
( See op@@ ening pic@@ ture . ) ( b ) What will we consider in this article ?
How , though , can you do that ?
The p@@ sal@@ mis@@ t David beg@@ ged Jehovah : “ L@@ ist@@ en to my prayer , O God . ”
When we are an@@ x@@ ious , why is prayer so important ?
( Read Matthew 11 : 28 - 30 . )
What did Jesus mean when he said : “ N@@ ever be an@@ x@@ ious ” ?
He ad@@ mit@@ ted : “ My angu@@ ished heart makes me g@@ ro@@ an al@@ ou@@ d . ”
( See the bo@@ x “ Some P@@ r@@ ac@@ tic@@ al W@@ a@@ ys to R@@ ed@@ u@@ ce An@@ x@@ i@@ ety . ” )
How can the meaning of God@@ ’@@ s name streng@@ then your faith ?

Why can you be conf@@ ident that your relationship with God will streng@@ then you ?
( a ) How can we th@@ row our an@@ x@@ i@@ ety on God ?
How can we be sure that Jehovah re@@ war@@ ds his servants ?
How did Jehovah bl@@ ess his servants in the past ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) How are love and faith con@@ nec@@ ted ?
How , though , does the hope of a re@@ ward benefit us ?
Jesus showed that his disciples would be re@@ war@@ ded for their sacrif@@ ices ( See par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h 5 )
The apostle Peter once asked Jesus : “ We have left all things and follow@@ ed you ; what , then , will there be for us ? ”
In the Ser@@ m@@ on on the M@@ ount , Jesus said : “ Re@@ jo@@ ice and be over@@ jo@@ yed , since your re@@ ward is great in the heav@@ ens , for in that way they per@@ sec@@ uted the proph@@ ets pri@@ or to you . ”
Moses told the nation of Israel : “ Jehovah will sur@@ ely bl@@ ess you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to poss@@ ess as an in@@ her@@ it@@ ance , but only if you str@@ ic@@ tly obe@@ y the vo@@ ice of Jehovah your God and car@@ e@@ fully ob@@ serve all this command@@ ment that I am giving you today .
For Jehovah your God will bl@@ ess you just as he has prom@@ ised you . ”
And he nam@@ ed the second one Eph@@ rai@@ m , for he said , ‘ God has made me fru@@ it@@ ful in the land of my aff@@ l@@ ic@@ tion . ’ ”
God@@ ’@@ s Word explain@@ s : “ For the joy that was set before him he end@@ ur@@ ed a tor@@ ture st@@ ake , des@@ p@@ is@@ ing sh@@ ame . ”
Jesus certainly found joy in being able to s@@ anc@@ tif@@ y God@@ ’@@ s name .
How does Jehovah feel about what we do for him ?
“ The one sho@@ wing fav@@ or to the low@@ ly is l@@ ending to Jehovah , and He will re@@ pa@@ y him for what he does . ”
What com@@ fort do we find at 1 John 3 : 19 , 20 ?
( Read 1 John 3 : 19 , 20 . )
What are some of the re@@ war@@ ds that we enjoy now ?
How do Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s servants feel about the re@@ war@@ ds they receive ?
For example , B@@ i@@ anc@@ a from Germany says : “ I cannot th@@ an@@ k Jehovah en@@ ough for help@@ ing me with my wor@@ ri@@ es and for being at my side each day .
The world out there is cha@@ o@@ tic and b@@ le@@ ak .
But as I work clos@@ ely with Jehovah , I feel sec@@ ure in his ar@@ ms .
Wh@@ en@@ ever I make personal sacrif@@ ices for him , he gives me back a h@@ und@@ re@@ d@@ fo@@ ld in bless@@ ings . ”
For my own encourag@@ ement , I keep a no@@ te@@ book with s@@ criptur@@ es and th@@ ough@@ ts from our publ@@ ic@@ ations that I can con@@ su@@ l@@ t from time to time .
I c@@ all it ‘ My S@@ ur@@ vi@@ val N@@ ot@@ e@@ book . ’
D@@ is@@ courag@@ ement is tem@@ por@@ ary if we fo@@ c@@ us on Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s prom@@ ises .
Jehovah is always there to help us , regar@@ d@@ less of our circum@@ stances . ”
Yet , you can likely think of ways in which Jehovah has re@@ war@@ ded you and those around you .
How were Paul and others set free from sin and death ?

11 , 12 . ( a ) After he sin@@ ned , what could David not do ?
What David could not do : David could not un@@ do what he had done .
He had to trust that when he truly rep@@ ented , Jehovah would for@@ give him and help him end@@ ure the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences of his ac@@ tions .
He had to leave the matter in Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s hand@@ s .

How many vo@@ ws have you made to Jehovah ?
What about your dedic@@ ation vo@@ w or your marriage vo@@ w ?
When we believe that we have person@@ ally experi@@ enced or ob@@ served an in@@ jus@@ tice , our faith , hum@@ ility , and loy@@ al@@ ty may be t@@ ested .
“ The world is pas@@ sing away and so is its desire , but the one who does the will of God remain@@ s for@@ ever . ” ​ — 1 J@@ O@@ H@@ N 2 : 17 .
What will Jehovah do about wicked people and cor@@ rup@@ t organ@@ iz@@ ations ?
The Bible says : “ The world is pas@@ sing away . ”
There is no dar@@ k@@ ness or de@@ ep sha@@ do@@ w where wr@@ ong@@ do@@ ers can con@@ ce@@ al themselves . ”
L@@ ater in the same p@@ sal@@ m , we read : “ The righteous will poss@@ ess the earth , and they will live for@@ ever on it . ”
Who are “ the me@@ ek ” and “ the righteous ” ?
Why can we be sure that the new earth will be well - organ@@ ized ?
After Ar@@ mag@@ ed@@ don , will there be any organization on earth ?
So the “ new earth ” will be organ@@ ized .

M@@ ost important , he did not al@@ low the im@@ perf@@ ec@@ tions and wrong ac@@ tions of others to se@@ par@@ ate him from Jehovah .
Why should we dra@@ w even clos@@ er to Jehovah if we experience in@@ jus@@ tice in the congregation ?
How can we show that we have conf@@ idence in “ the Jud@@ ge of all the earth ” ?
See W@@ ill@@ i D@@ i@@ e@@ h@@ l@@ ’@@ s life st@@ ory , “ Jehovah Is My God , in W@@ ho@@ m I Will Tr@@ ust , ” in the No@@ v@@ ember 1 , 199@@ 1 , is@@ sue of The Watchtower .

What does the Bible say about div@@ or@@ ce and se@@ par@@ ation ?
( Read 1 Corinthians 7 : 10 , 11 . )

F@@ in@@ ally , he held up the emp@@ ty b@@ a@@ g and said with a sm@@ ile : ‘ You see ?
This is all you need ! ’ ” ​ — Read 1 Timothy 6 : 8 .
They need to sense Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s love and com@@ pas@@ sion among their fellow Christians .
Many of to@@ da@@ y@@ ’@@ s re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es come from countries where our preaching work is res@@ tr@@ ic@@ ted .
She said : “ The brothers there tre@@ ated them like close relati@@ ves , provid@@ ing food , clo@@ th@@ es , sh@@ el@@ ter , and tr@@ an@@ sp@@ or@@ t@@ ation .
Who el@@ se would w@@ el@@ come str@@ ang@@ ers into their home just because they worship the same God ?
On@@ ly Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses ! ” ​ — Read John 13 : 35 .
As soon as possible after a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e arr@@ ives , elders should follow the dir@@ ection in Or@@ gan@@ ized to Do Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s Will , chap@@ ter 8 , par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h 30 .

( b ) What questions will this article discus@@ s ?
“ But after I started school , I began to pre@@ f@@ er the local language .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in a few years , the sh@@ if@@ t was compl@@ ete .
I cou@@ ld@@ n@@ ’@@ t understand the meetings , and I di@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t id@@ entif@@ y with my parents ’ cul@@ ture . ”
3 , 4 . ( a ) How can parents set a good example for their children ?
( b ) What should parents not exp@@ ect of their children ?
When your children see you “ se@@ ek@@ ing first the Kingdom , ” they learn to de@@ p@@ end on Jehovah for their da@@ ily needs .
N@@ ever get so bus@@ y that you do not have time for your children .
How may your children benefit from lear@@ ning your language ?
Par@@ ents , if that describ@@ es your children , can you learn at le@@ ast some of the local language ?
A child who commun@@ ic@@ ates best in another spok@@ en language des@@ er@@ ves the same concer@@ n , would you not ag@@ ree ?
If that is your situation , you can still help your children to come to know and love Jehovah .
“ But when we saw her stud@@ ying , pra@@ ying , and doing her best to conduct family worship every we@@ ek , we under@@ sto@@ od that g@@ etting to know Jehovah was very important . ”
How can parents help children who may need to study in two langu@@ ages ?
( a ) Who must dec@@ ide which language congregation to att@@ end ?
That may not be the case when children do not fully understand the language .
( Read 1 Corinthians 14 : 9 , 11 . )
The answer was not what we person@@ ally found conven@@ i@@ ent .
But when we saw that they were g@@ etting little benefit from the meetings in our language , we dec@@ ided to move to the local - language congregation .
To@@ gether , we reg@@ ularly att@@ ended meetings and sh@@ ared in the ministry .
We also inv@@ ited local friends to jo@@ in us for me@@ als and exc@@ ur@@ sions .
All of this helped our children to get to know the brothers and to get to know Jehovah , not only as their God but also as their Father and F@@ ri@@ end .
We consid@@ ered this to be much more important than their mas@@ ter@@ ing our language . ”
Samuel ad@@ ds : “ To keep ourselves spiritually strong , my wife and I also att@@ ended meetings in our language .
Li@@ fe was very bus@@ y , and we were tir@@ ed .
But we th@@ an@@ k Jehovah for bless@@ ing our ef@@ forts and sacrif@@ ices .
Our three children are all serving Jehovah in the full - time ministry . ”
“ I knew the bas@@ ics of my parents ’ language , but the language spok@@ en at the meetings was over my head , ” rec@@ all@@ s Krist@@ ina .
“ When I was 12 , I att@@ ended a conven@@ tion in my school language .
For the first time , I under@@ sto@@ od that what I was hear@@ ing was the truth !
Ano@@ ther tur@@ ning point came when I began to pray in my school language .
I could speak to Jehovah from my heart ! ”
Y@@ oun@@ g people , do you think that you would pre@@ f@@ er being part of a local - language congregation ?
“ When my s@@ ib@@ l@@ ings and I got into our te@@ ens , we wanted to s@@ wit@@ ch to the local - language congregation , ” says Na@@ dia , who now ser@@ ves at Be@@ the@@ l .
“ Now we@@ ’@@ r@@ e gr@@ at@@ eful that our parents wor@@ ked hard to teach us their language and kept us in the for@@ e@@ ign - language congregation .
It has en@@ ri@@ ched our lives and bro@@ ad@@ ened our opport@@ un@@ ities to help others get to know Jehovah . ”
( b ) How can parents get help in teaching their children the truth ?
( Read Proverbs 1 : 8 ; 31 : 10 , 27 , 28 . )
S@@ till , parents who do not know the local language may need help to re@@ ach their ch@@ ild@@ r@@ en@@ ’@@ s heart .
B@@ oth children and parents benefit from associ@@ ation with the congregation ( See par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h@@ s 18 , 19 )
( b ) What must parents continue to do ?
“ When they helped me with stud@@ ent talk as@@ sign@@ ments for the meet@@ ing , I always learned more .
And I enjo@@ yed the le@@ is@@ ure activ@@ ities we sh@@ ared in as a group . ”
Par@@ ents , pray to Jehovah for help , and try your best .

At that time , she gave me a pi@@ ec@@ e of c@@ and@@ y and asked if we could be friends .
When she wanted to get baptized , her parents told her , “ Bec@@ ome one of Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , and you will have to leave our home ! ”
She continu@@ ed her study and later got baptized .
When we got married in 19@@ 60 , her parents did not come to our wed@@ ding .

How can we keep our love for Jehovah strong ?
How can we de@@ ep@@ en our love for Bible truth ?
Why is it important to have aff@@ ection for our brothers ?
What may have ca@@ used the love of some Christians to g@@ row co@@ ld ?
Pe@@ ople today have less and less love for God .
S@@ how love for Jehovah ( See par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h 10 )
( Read Psalm 1@@ 19 : 9@@ 7 - 1@@ 00 . )
S@@ how love for Bible truth ( See par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h 14 )
On his last night on earth , Jesus said to his disciples : “ I am giving you a new command@@ ment , that you love one another ; just as I have loved you , you also love one another .
By this all will know that you are my disciples ​ — if you have love among your@@ selves . ” ​ — John 13 : 34 , 35 .
The apostle John wrote : “ The one who does not love his brother , whom he has seen , cannot love God , whom he has not seen . ”
S@@ how love for the brothers and s@@ isters ( See par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h 17 )
What are some ways in which we can show love ?
Read 1 Th@@ ess@@ al@@ on@@ ians 4 : 9 , 10 .
“ Sim@@ on son of John , do you love me more than these ? ” ​ — J@@ O@@ H@@ N 21 : 15 .
Then he said to them : “ ‘ C@@ ast the ne@@ t on the right side of the bo@@ at and you will find some . ’
So they c@@ ast it , but they were not able to ha@@ ul it in because of the large number of f@@ ish . ” ​ — John 21 : 1 - 6 .
( b ) What valu@@ able less@@ on did a brother in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and learn about his work ?
As a result , it left me al@@ most no time for spiritual matters .
I fin@@ ally real@@ ized that in order to put Kingdom inter@@ ests first , I needed to change my line of work . ”
“ After pl@@ an@@ ning for about a year , ” he explain@@ ed , “ I dec@@ ided to become a st@@ re@@ et v@@ end@@ or and sel@@ l ice cre@@ am .
In the beg@@ in@@ ning , I str@@ ug@@ g@@ led fin@@ anci@@ ally and got dis@@ courag@@ ed .

I pray@@ ed to Jehovah , as@@ king him to help me to c@@ ope and to re@@ ach my go@@ al of having more time for spiritual activ@@ ities .
I got better ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ ted with my c@@ us@@ tom@@ ers ’ t@@ ast@@ es and became more sk@@ ill@@ ful in making ice cre@@ am .
So@@ on , I was sel@@ ling all my ice cre@@ am every day .
Ac@@ t@@ ually , I was better - off fin@@ anci@@ ally than when I wor@@ ked with com@@ put@@ ers .
It has made me happ@@ i@@ er because I do not have the str@@ ess and wor@@ ry that I had with my form@@ er jo@@ b .
And most important , I now feel clos@@ er to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Matthew 5 : 3 , 6 .
After his bap@@ tis@@ m , he said : “ The only re@@ gre@@ t I have is that I lost so much time before I real@@ ized that serving Jehovah br@@ ings far more happiness than pur@@ su@@ ing the ent@@ er@@ tain@@ ment offer@@ ed by this world . ”
Jesus st@@ ated that “ no one can slave for two mas@@ ters . ”
He add@@ ed : “ You cannot slave for God and for R@@ ich@@ es . ”

When I went home and ch@@ ec@@ ked the Watchtower and A@@ wake !
magaz@@ ines from the pre@@ vi@@ ous mon@@ ths , I found an article explain@@ ing that Daniel was written in Ar@@ am@@ ai@@ c . ”
As you do this , you will bu@@ ild up “ t@@ reas@@ ure in the heav@@ ens , where no th@@ i@@ ef g@@ ets near and no m@@ oth cons@@ um@@ es .
For where your t@@ reas@@ ure is , there your hear@@ ts will be also . ” ​ — Luke 12 : 33 , 34 .

As my ir@@ rit@@ ation gre@@ w , I started being cur@@ t with her .
I thought , ‘ She does not show me the respect I des@@ er@@ ve , so I am not going to show her respect . ’ ”
“ I began se@@ e@@ ing my own person@@ ality fl@@ a@@ ws , and I was very dis@@ appoin@@ ted in my@@ self .
I real@@ ized that I had to ad@@ just my thinking .

If you are g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing , you too can find so@@ o@@ thing com@@ fort from such s@@ criptur@@ es as the following :
( Read 1 Th@@ ess@@ al@@ on@@ ians 5 : 11 . )
What do we need to rem@@ ember about g@@ ri@@ ef ?
Even when someone does expres@@ s how he feel@@ s , it is not always eas@@ y for others to understand what he is tr@@ ying to say .
At that m@@ om@@ ent , I d@@ on@@ ’@@ t feel qu@@ ite so alone in my g@@ ri@@ ef . ”
“ R@@ ec@@ e@@ iving a shor@@ t encourag@@ ing message or an inv@@ it@@ ation to sp@@ end time with a fellow Christian help@@ s me more than I can say , ” says J@@ un@@ ia .
“ Those expres@@ sions make me feel loved and car@@ ed for . ”
“ S@@ om@@ etimes when s@@ isters have come to com@@ fort me , ” rec@@ all@@ s D@@ al@@ ene , “ I have asked them if they are will@@ ing to say a prayer .
They star@@ t pra@@ ying , often bat@@ t@@ ling to speak at first , but every time , with@@ in a few s@@ ent@@ ences , their vo@@ ice g@@ ets str@@ ong@@ er and they say the most hear@@ t@@ felt prayer .
Their strong faith , their love , and their concer@@ n have been very faith - streng@@ th@@ ening . ”
“ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of distr@@ ess . ”
“ I expec@@ ted my first wed@@ ding ann@@ iver@@ s@@ ary to be very tr@@ a@@ um@@ ati@@ c , ” rel@@ ates one brother , “ and it was not eas@@ y .
But a few brothers and s@@ isters pl@@ an@@ ned a small ga@@ ther@@ ing of my clos@@ est friends so that I w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n@@ ’@@ t be on my own . ”
“ O@@ f@@ ten the help and compan@@ i@@ on@@ ship offer@@ ed when there is no special ann@@ iver@@ s@@ ary can be very benef@@ ic@@ ial , ” explain@@ s J@@ un@@ ia .
“ Those sp@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ous m@@ om@@ ents are so valu@@ able and bring much com@@ fort . ”
They have truly made me feel Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s loving ar@@ ms around me . ”
Why are Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s prom@@ ises a so@@ ur@@ ce of great com@@ fort ?
God prom@@ ises that “ he will do away with death for@@ ever , and the S@@ over@@ e@@ ign Lord Jehovah will w@@ ip@@ e away the te@@ ars from all fac@@ es . ”
O@@ ther s@@ criptur@@ es that many have found com@@ for@@ ting are Psalm 20 : 1 , 2 ; 31 : 7 ; 38 : 8 , 9 , 15 ; 5@@ 5 : 22 ; 1@@ 21 : 1 , 2 ; Isaiah 5@@ 7 : 15 ; 6@@ 6 : 13 ; Philipp@@ ians 4 : 13 ; and 1 Peter 5 : 7 .

“ Your loved one will never have to face the last enem@@ y , death , ever again .

( Read Psalm 14@@ 7 : 8 , 9 . )
Mut@@ su@@ o says : “ I felt that Jehovah was right next to each one of us and car@@ ing for us .
12 , 13 . ( a ) To benefit from God@@ ’@@ s help , what should we avoid ?
On the other hand , God “ hur@@ ls the wicked to the gr@@ ound . ”
“ Jehovah f@@ ind@@ s pleas@@ ure in those who fear him , in those wa@@ iting for his loy@@ al love . ”
15 - 17 . ( a ) How might we at times feel about our tr@@ ials , but how does Jehovah use his Word to help us ?
Today , Jehovah gu@@ id@@ es us with his Word , the Bible .
( Read Psalm 14@@ 7 : 19 , 20 . )
What pl@@ ans can lead to a happy future for you ?
What could a life in the pione@@ er service lead to ?
Y@@ O@@ U young ones will prob@@ ably ag@@ ree that before star@@ ting a jo@@ ur@@ ne@@ y , it is wise to pl@@ an where you will go .
Li@@ fe is like a jo@@ ur@@ ne@@ y , and the time to pl@@ an where you want to go is when you are young .
How do you know that Jehovah wan@@ ts you to pl@@ an for a happy future ?
Your Creator is “ the God of love , ” “ the happy God , ” who made humans “ in his im@@ age . ”
You will be happy when you im@@ itate our loving God .
Jesus Christ set the perfect example for you young ones .
Jesus also d@@ re@@ w close to Jehovah by stud@@ ying the Scriptures .
“ P@@ l@@ ans fai@@ l when there is no con@@ su@@ l@@ t@@ ation , but there is ac@@ compl@@ ish@@ ment through many ad@@ vis@@ ers . ”
As with any car@@ e@@ er , you need time to become sk@@ ill@@ ed .
At first , I cou@@ ld@@ n@@ ’@@ t star@@ t any Bible stu@@ dies , but later I moved to another ter@@ rit@@ ory , and with@@ in a mon@@ th I started sever@@ al stu@@ dies .
One stud@@ ent began coming to the Kingdom H@@ all .
For example , J@@ ac@@ o@@ b , from N@@ or@@ th America , wr@@ ites : “ When I was se@@ ven , many of my cl@@ ass@@ mat@@ es were V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese .
I wanted to tell them about Jehovah , so after a while I made pl@@ ans to learn their language .
For the most part , I learned by com@@ par@@ ing the Eng@@ l@@ ish and V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese ed@@ itions of The Watchtower .
I also made friends in a ne@@ ar@@ by V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese - language congregation .
When I was 18 , I started pione@@ ering .
L@@ ater , I att@@ ended the Bible S@@ chool for S@@ ing@@ le Bro@@ thers .
This helped me with my present pione@@ er as@@ sign@@ ment , where I am the only eld@@ er in a V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese - language group .
Many V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese people are am@@ az@@ ed that I have learned their language .
They inv@@ ite me in , and often I can study the Bible with them .
Some have pro@@ g@@ res@@ sed to bap@@ tis@@ m . ” ​ — Com@@ pare Acts 2 : 7 , 8 .
I enjoy encourag@@ ing the young brothers in our congregation and se@@ e@@ ing their spiritual pro@@ g@@ ress .
After I att@@ ended the Bible S@@ chool for S@@ ing@@ le Bro@@ thers , I received a new pione@@ er as@@ sign@@ ment .
I@@ t@@ ’@@ s true that I have never found anyone in the ter@@ rit@@ ory who pro@@ g@@ res@@ sed to bap@@ tis@@ m , but others have .
How may pione@@ er service lead to other opport@@ un@@ ities ?
A brother nam@@ ed K@@ ev@@ in says : “ E@@ ver since I was a little bo@@ y , I have wanted to serve Jehovah full - time some@@ day .
F@@ in@@ ally , I started pione@@ ering when I was 19 .
I sup@@ por@@ ted my@@ self working part - time for a brother who was a build@@ er .
I learned to inst@@ all ro@@ of@@ s , win@@ do@@ ws , and do@@ ors .
L@@ ater , I sp@@ ent two years with a hur@@ r@@ ic@@ ane reli@@ ef te@@ am , re@@ build@@ ing Kingdom H@@ all@@ s and hom@@ es for the brothers .
When I heard about the con@@ struc@@ tion needs in South Africa , I ap@@ pli@@ ed and was inv@@ ited to go .
Here in Africa , I move from one Kingdom H@@ all pro@@ ject to another every few we@@ ek@@ s .
We live together , study the Bible together , and work together .
I also enjoy preaching with the local brothers each we@@ ek .
The pl@@ ans I made as a bo@@ y have made me happy in ways I did not for@@ es@@ e@@ e . ”
Be@@ the@@ l service is a happy way of life because every@@ thing you do there is for Jehovah .
After a year and a half , I was inv@@ ited to Be@@ the@@ l , where I learned to op@@ er@@ ate pr@@ in@@ ting pres@@ ses and later to do com@@ put@@ er pro@@ gr@@ am@@ m@@ ing .
At Be@@ the@@ l , I enjoy hear@@ ing fir@@ s@@ th@@ and about the pro@@ g@@ ress of the discip@@ le - making activ@@ ity world@@ wide .
I love serving here because what we do help@@ s people to dra@@ w close to Jehovah . ”
You can be sure that Jehovah wan@@ ts you to “ get a fir@@ m hold ” on a happy future .
( Read 1 Timothy 6 : 18 , 19 . )
Then pl@@ an to do what is pleas@@ ing to him .
He has stu@@ died human be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or since man was cre@@ ated .
I@@ t@@ ’@@ s something you have to find out for yourself . ”
and “ Do not let them lead you into dis@@ as@@ ter ! ”
Jesus said : “ Do not fear those who k@@ ill the body and after this are not able to do any@@ thing more . ”
Do not be struc@@ k with ter@@ ro@@ r or fear , for Jehovah your God is with you wh@@ er@@ ever you go . ”
L@@ ist@@ en to Jehovah and trust in him in all that you do .
The second article high@@ l@@ igh@@ ts how Jehovah can do the un@@ expec@@ ted by ac@@ compl@@ ish@@ ing things we could never im@@ ag@@ ine .
L@@ ike the far@@ m@@ er , we need to wa@@ it pati@@ ently .
What can we learn from the example of the prophet M@@ ic@@ ah ?
( Read M@@ ic@@ ah 7 : 1 - 3 . )
If we have faith like that of M@@ ic@@ ah , we will be will@@ ing to wa@@ it for Jehovah .
So we “ end@@ ure fully with pati@@ ence and joy . ”
Abraham had to wa@@ it many years before his gr@@ and@@ sons E@@ sa@@ u and J@@ ac@@ o@@ b were born ( See par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h@@ s 9 , 10 )
( Read Hebrews 11 : 8 - 12 . )
But just im@@ ag@@ ine Abra@@ ham@@ ’@@ s joy when he is resurrec@@ ted back to a par@@ adise earth .
Although you me@@ ant to har@@ m me , God int@@ ended it to turn out well and to pres@@ er@@ ve many people al@@ ive , as he is doing today . ”
( b ) What helped David to wa@@ it pati@@ ently ?
I will sing to Jehovah , for he has ri@@ ch@@ ly re@@ war@@ ded me . ”
( Read 2 Peter 3 : 9 . )
What will help us to be will@@ ing to wa@@ it pati@@ ently ?
What less@@ ons do we learn from what happ@@ ened to the apostle Paul in Philipp@@ i ?
( Read Acts 16 : 8 - 10 . )
So@@ on after he arr@@ ived in M@@ ac@@ ed@@ on@@ ia , he ended up in pris@@ on !
Why did Jehovah al@@ low this to happ@@ en to Paul ?
B@@ oth he and S@@ il@@ as started “ pra@@ ying and pra@@ is@@ ing God with s@@ ong . ”
4 , 5 . ( a ) How could our situation be similar to that of Paul ?
( b ) How did Pa@@ ul@@ ’@@ s situation change un@@ expec@@ t@@ edly ?
What will we now discus@@ s and re@@ view together ?
( Read 1 Peter 5 : 6 , 7 . )
S@@ om@@ etimes he sur@@ pris@@ es us by doing the un@@ expec@@ ted .
Jehovah sent an ang@@ el to destro@@ y 18@@ 5@@ ,000 of S@@ en@@ n@@ ach@@ er@@ ib@@ ’@@ s sol@@ di@@ ers in one night .
( a ) What less@@ on do we learn from what happ@@ ened to Joseph ?
No doub@@ t Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s ac@@ tions exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ed all of Josep@@ h@@ ’@@ s expec@@ t@@ ations .
Th@@ in@@ k , too , about Josep@@ h@@ ’@@ s great - gr@@ and@@ mother S@@ ar@@ ah .
( Read Isaiah 43 : 10 - 13 . )
We know that Jehovah car@@ es for us and wan@@ ts us to succ@@ e@@ ed .
How can we str@@ ip off and keep off the old person@@ ality ?
By 19@@ 39 there were 6@@ ,000 of them in the [ con@@ c@@ entr@@ ation cam@@ p@@ s ] . ”
And you people have cle@@ an@@ ed the st@@ a@@ di@@ um so n@@ ic@@ ely .
But most of all , you are truly mu@@ l@@ tir@@ ac@@ ial . ”
But the more I had sex@@ ual rel@@ ations , the more in@@ sec@@ ure I felt . ”
This way of life continu@@ ed until Sa@@ kura was 23 years old .
It got so bad that I could not wa@@ it for the woman I was living with to leave the house so that I could wat@@ ch por@@ no@@ gr@@ ap@@ hi@@ c vid@@ e@@ o@@ s . ”
What helped St@@ ep@@ h@@ en to put away anger and ab@@ us@@ ive spe@@ ec@@ h ?
He says : “ Our family life im@@ proved d@@ ram@@ ati@@ c@@ ally .
Today , St@@ ep@@ h@@ en ser@@ ves as a minis@@ ter@@ ial servan@@ t , and his wife has been a reg@@ ular pione@@ er for sever@@ al years .
Bible t@@ ex@@ ts that encourag@@ ed me were Isaiah 5@@ 5 : 7 , which says : ‘ Let the wicked man leave his way , ’ and 1 Corinthians 6 : 11 , which says about those who had ab@@ and@@ oned sin@@ ful ways : ‘ And yet that is what some of you were . ’
For many years , Jehovah pati@@ ently helped me by means of his holy spirit to put on the new person@@ ality . ”
We also benefit from God@@ ’@@ s Word and his holy spirit when we pre@@ pare for and att@@ end congregation meetings .
See chap@@ ter 25 in the book Q@@ u@@ es@@ tions Y@@ oun@@ g Pe@@ ople As@@ k ​ — An@@ s@@ wers That Wor@@ k , V@@ ol@@ ume 1 .

Then he att@@ ended a meet@@ ing of Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
You get to experience our world@@ wide bro@@ ther@@ ho@@ od and see its mir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ous unity fir@@ s@@ th@@ and . ”
When we showed them s@@ criptur@@ es from their P@@ or@@ t@@ ug@@ u@@ ese Bible , such as Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 or Psalm 37 : 10 , 11 , 29 , they pa@@ id attention and som@@ etimes even sh@@ ed te@@ ars . ”
We are so th@@ an@@ k@@ ful to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Acts 10 : 34 , 35 .
What example did Jesus set in sho@@ wing m@@ ild@@ ness and pati@@ ence ?
Then he add@@ ed : “ If you continue sho@@ wing fav@@ or@@ it@@ ism , you are comm@@ it@@ ting sin . ”
Why is it important that we clo@@ the ourselves with love ?
Lo@@ ve is also “ pati@@ ent and kind ” and “ does not get pu@@ ff@@ ed up . ”
Paul said that without love , he was “ nothing . ”
The love is in this respect , not that we have loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son as a prop@@ iti@@ at@@ ory sacrifice for our sin@@ s . ”
Jesus said : “ No one has love gre@@ ater than this , that someone should sur@@ r@@ end@@ er his life in be@@ half of his friends . ”
Let us consider how we can do so .
John wrote : “ L@@ it@@ tle children , we should love , not in word or with the t@@ ong@@ ue , but in de@@ ed and truth . ”
But then I asked my@@ self , ‘ How can I im@@ itate Jesus in de@@ al@@ ing with this person ? ’
After refl@@ ec@@ ting on what Jesus would have done , I dec@@ ided to let the matter go and not make an is@@ sue of it .
L@@ ater , I learned that my co@@ work@@ er had been cop@@ ing with a serious health problem and was under a lo@@ t of str@@ ess .
I con@@ clud@@ ed that she prob@@ ably did not really mean what she wrote .
R@@ ef@@ l@@ ec@@ ting on Jesus ’ example of sho@@ wing love even when prov@@ ok@@ ed helped me to show similar love to my co@@ work@@ er . ”
By le@@ av@@ ing heaven , “ he emp@@ ti@@ ed himself ” in our be@@ half , even “ to the point of death . ”
P@@ E@@ A@@ C@@ E : “ P@@ ut@@ ting up with one another in love ” al@@ lo@@ ws us to enjoy “ the un@@ iting b@@ ond of peace . ”
W@@ ould you not ag@@ ree that such a pe@@ ac@@ eful spirit is truly un@@ i@@ qu@@ e in to@@ da@@ y@@ ’@@ s di@@ vid@@ ed world ?
Paul wrote : “ Lo@@ ve bu@@ il@@ ds up . ”
The following day , they had out@@ g@@ ro@@ wn the ven@@ ue . ”
B@@ el@@ o@@ w the pic@@ ture was the cap@@ tion : “ In@@ vas@@ ion of the st@@ re@@ ets . ”

( b ) Why should you be inter@@ ested in what the Bible says about com@@ pas@@ sion ?
( a ) Why did Jehovah s@@ end ang@@ els to So@@ dom ?
( Read Ex@@ od@@ us 22 : 26 , 27 . )
We read : “ Jehovah the God of their for@@ ef@@ a@@ thers kept war@@ ning them by means of his mess@@ eng@@ ers , war@@ ning them again and again , because he felt com@@ pas@@ sion for his people and for his d@@ well@@ ing place . ”
“ He started to teach them many things . ”
Inst@@ ead , we need to do all we can now to help people .
One meaning of com@@ pas@@ sion is “ to su@@ ff@@ er together . ”
“ Be courag@@ e@@ ous and strong and go to work .
How can young ones and their parents show courage ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What important as@@ sign@@ ment did Solomon receive ?
To succ@@ e@@ ed , Solomon would need to be courag@@ e@@ ous and go to work .
What could Solomon learn about courage from his father ?
( Read 1 Ch@@ ron@@ ic@@ les 28 : 20 . )
How did Jesus ’ courage aff@@ ect the apostles ?
Let us consider two are@@ as of life where we need courage : in our family and in the congregation .
( b ) How can young ones im@@ itate Moses ’ example ?
He will help them provide for the needs of their famil@@ ies .
She wr@@ ites : “ G@@ row@@ ing up , I was really sh@@ y .

With the help of her parents and others in the congregation , this young Christian achi@@ ev@@ ed her go@@ al of becom@@ ing a reg@@ ular pione@@ er .
How can Psalm 37 : 25 and Hebrews 13 : 5 help parents ?
( Read Psalm 37 : 25 ; Hebrews 13 : 5 . )
A brother who has two children wrote : “ Many parents exp@@ end much ef@@ fort and res@@ our@@ ces help@@ ing their children re@@ ach go@@ als in such are@@ as as sp@@ or@@ ts , rec@@ re@@ ation , and educ@@ ation .
It makes so much more sense to exp@@ end ef@@ fort and res@@ our@@ ces in help@@ ing our children re@@ ach go@@ als that will help them to main@@ tain a good standing with Jehovah .
It has been a great so@@ ur@@ ce of satis@@ fac@@ tion not only to see our children re@@ ach spiritual go@@ als but to share the jo@@ ur@@ ne@@ y with them . ”
G@@ ive exam@@ ples of courage in the Christian congregation .
( a ) How can baptized brothers be courag@@ e@@ ous ?

The eld@@ er rec@@ all@@ ed : “ G@@ ra@@ ham had a problem with pr@@ ide .
He was cr@@ itical of the elders who had been involved in his dis@@ fel@@ low@@ sh@@ ipp@@ ing .
So for the next few stu@@ dies , we discus@@ sed s@@ criptur@@ es on pr@@ ide and its eff@@ ects .
G@@ ra@@ ham began to see himself c@@ learly in the mir@@ ro@@ r of God@@ ’@@ s Word , and he did not like what he saw !
After ac@@ knowled@@ g@@ ing that he had been bl@@ ind@@ ed by a ‘ ra@@ f@@ ter ’ of pr@@ ide and that his cr@@ itical attitude was his problem , he began to change qu@@ ick@@ ly for the better .
He started to att@@ end Christian meetings reg@@ ularly , to study God@@ ’@@ s Word ear@@ nes@@ tly , and to make da@@ ily prayer a hab@@ it .
‘ I@@ ’@@ ve known the truth for years , ’ he said , ‘ and I@@ ’@@ ve even served as a pione@@ er .
The apostle Peter wrote : “ S@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ d the f@@ loc@@ k of God under your care , serving as overse@@ ers , not under com@@ p@@ ul@@ sion , but will@@ ingly before God ; not for love of dis@@ hon@@ est gain , but e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly ; not l@@ ording it over those who are God@@ ’@@ s in@@ her@@ it@@ ance , but becom@@ ing exam@@ ples to the f@@ loc@@ k . ”
How can parents ra@@ ise their children in the discip@@ line of Jehovah ?

How can we become better stud@@ ents of God@@ ’@@ s Word ?
One brother wrote : “ I am fill@@ ed with gr@@ at@@ itude for the way my parents ra@@ ised me .
( b ) How did one family benefit from the parents ’ obedi@@ ence to Jehovah ?
( b ) How can we make the elders ’ work more pleas@@ ant for them ?
They did not ber@@ ate me or cr@@ it@@ ic@@ ize me , but they encourag@@ ed me and streng@@ th@@ ened me .
After every congregation meet@@ ing , no matter how bus@@ y they were , at le@@ ast one of them would ask how I was .
Because of my past , I found it difficult to feel wor@@ thy of God@@ ’@@ s love .
Tim@@ e and time again , however , Jehovah has used the congregation and the elders to con@@ fir@@ m his love for me .
I pray that I will never let him go . ”
If you turn to doing good , will you not be res@@ tor@@ ed to fav@@ or ?
But if you do not turn to doing good , sin is cr@@ ou@@ ch@@ ing at the do@@ or , and its c@@ ra@@ ving is to dom@@ in@@ ate you ; but will you get the mas@@ ter@@ y over it ? ”
So let us “ list@@ en to discip@@ line and become wise . ”

L@@ ike that p@@ il@@ ot , Adam and E@@ ve wanted to do things their own way .
He said : “ If you remain in my word , you are really my disciples , and you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free . ”
Why can the fre@@ edom that Jesus prom@@ ised make us “ truly free ” ?

17 , 18 . ( a ) What does Jehovah want for young people today ?
I was born in a one - ro@@ om lo@@ g c@@ ab@@ in in a very small to@@ wn called L@@ ib@@ er@@ ty , Indi@@ ana , U.@@ S@@ .@@ A .
L@@ ater , my mother gave bir@@ th to my two youn@@ g@@ er brothers and my youn@@ g@@ er sis@@ ter .
D@@ UR@@ IN@@ G my school years , not much chang@@ ed .
The to@@ wn of L@@ ib@@ er@@ ty was sur@@ r@@ ound@@ ed by small far@@ ms , and the bas@@ ic c@@ ro@@ p was cor@@ n .
She took us to the B@@ ap@@ tis@@ t church every S@@ un@@ day .
They wanted me to make the mil@@ it@@ ary my car@@ e@@ er .
This time , however , they inv@@ ited me to come to a C@@ ong@@ reg@@ ation Bo@@ ok St@@ ud@@ y , a small meet@@ ing for Bible study and discus@@ sion that was held in their home .
I told them I would think about it .
I cou@@ ld@@ n@@ ’@@ t believe how much they knew about the Bible !
Y@@ ear@@ s before , when I asked my mother about Jehova@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , she simply said , “ O@@ h , they worship some old man nam@@ ed Jehovah . ”
But I now felt that my eyes were being op@@ ened !
I started pione@@ ering the next year , in 195@@ 8 .
G@@ l@@ or@@ ia was a j@@ e@@ we@@ l then , and she is a j@@ e@@ we@@ l today .
G@@ l@@ or@@ ia and I got married in Fe@@ b@@ ru@@ ary of 195@@ 9 .
A de@@ ar brother , Sim@@ on K@@ r@@ ak@@ er , inter@@ vie@@ wed us .
He told us that Be@@ the@@ l was not accep@@ ting married cou@@ ples at that time .
M@@ ost of our jo@@ bs pa@@ id three d@@ ol@@ l@@ ars a day .
E@@ ach we@@ ek , G@@ l@@ or@@ ia did ir@@ on@@ ing for one family .
I rem@@ ember one time when we st@@ op@@ ped at a g@@ as st@@ ation .
On the other hand , we had wond@@ erful times with the brothers , and we loved our ministry !
Me@@ an@@ while , I started a study with the c@@ oup@@ le@@ ’@@ s daugh@@ ter and her husband .
M@@ other and daugh@@ ter both dec@@ ided to serve Jehovah and got baptized .
We had de@@ ar friends in the wh@@ ite congregation .
The K@@ u K@@ l@@ u@@ x K@@ l@@ an ( K@@ K@@ K ) , an organization that prom@@ ot@@ es r@@ ac@@ ism and viol@@ ence , was very ac@@ tive then .
In 19@@ 6@@ 2 , I was inv@@ ited to att@@ end the Kingdom M@@ in@@ is@@ try S@@ chool at South L@@ ans@@ ing , New York .
However , a t@@ el@@ ep@@ h@@ one compan@@ y in P@@ ine B@@ l@@ u@@ f@@ f had inter@@ vie@@ wed me for a jo@@ b .
If they h@@ ir@@ ed me , I would be the first bl@@ ack man to work for that compan@@ y .
I had no money to trav@@ el to New York .
She said , “ G@@ o to school and learn as much as you can , and come back and teach us ! ”
I am so gl@@ ad that I did not take that jo@@ b !
Here is how G@@ l@@ or@@ ia rem@@ embers our time in P@@ ine B@@ l@@ u@@ f@@ f : “ I f@@ ell in love with the ter@@ rit@@ ory !
So we would go in the house - to - house work in the mor@@ ning and then conduct Bible stu@@ dies the res@@ t of the day , som@@ etimes until 11 o@@ ’@@ c@@ loc@@ k at night .
While we were pione@@ ering in P@@ ine B@@ l@@ u@@ f@@ f , we ap@@ pli@@ ed to become special pione@@ ers .
Bro@@ ther Le@@ on W@@ e@@ av@@ er , now the co@@ ord@@ in@@ at@@ or of the United States B@@ ran@@ ch Com@@ mit@@ te@@ e , was appoin@@ ted to serve as a circ@@ u@@ it overse@@ er at the same time .
I was ner@@ v@@ ous about becom@@ ing a circ@@ u@@ it overse@@ er .
After I was appoin@@ ted , Bro@@ ther T@@ hom@@ p@@ son was the first distr@@ ic@@ t overse@@ er I served with .
In those days , a circ@@ u@@ it overse@@ er received little train@@ ing .
I rem@@ ember saying to G@@ l@@ or@@ ia , “ Does he really have to leave now ? ”
One time , the K@@ K@@ K held a mar@@ ch in a to@@ wn we were vis@@ iting in T@@ en@@ nes@@ see .
The following mon@@ th , we began our Be@@ the@@ l service .
G@@ l@@ or@@ ia was a j@@ e@@ we@@ l when I married her , and she still is
Then in 199@@ 9 , I was appoin@@ ted to be a m@@ ember of the G@@ over@@ ning B@@ od@@ y .
Isaiah 32 : 17 says : “ The result of true righteousness will be peace , and the fru@@ it@@ age of true righteousness will be lasting tr@@ an@@ qu@@ ill@@ ity and sec@@ ur@@ ity . ”
S@@ ec@@ ond , we must pray for God@@ ’@@ s holy spirit .
If the house is des@@ er@@ ving , let the peace you wish it come upon it ; but if it is not des@@ er@@ ving , let the peace from you return upon you . ”
So I gre@@ et@@ ed her in her own t@@ ong@@ ue .
T@@ ak@@ en by sur@@ pris@@ e , she asked me , ‘ What is the reason for your vis@@ it ? ’
I pol@@ it@@ ely told her that I wis@@ h@@ ed to see the H@@ igh Com@@ mission@@ er .
She t@@ el@@ ep@@ h@@ oned the off@@ ic@@ ial , who came out to me@@ et me and gre@@ et@@ ed me in the local language .
After that , he car@@ e@@ fully list@@ ened to me as I explain@@ ed to him the pe@@ ac@@ eful activ@@ ities of the Witnesses . ”

We need to know our enem@@ y , but we do not need to be ter@@ rif@@ ied by him .
