Th@@ rough the years , there were times when our spirituality weak@@ ened .
So why has God cho@@ s@@ en to allow the issue to go on , giving Satan time to try to prove his point ?
To@@ ñ@@ i gave a fine witness , and a Bible study was started — all as a result of her cal@@ m and peace@@ able de@@ mean@@ or .

“ You will . . . see the dist@@ in@@ ction between a righteous person and a wicked person . ” — MA@@ L .
( Judg . 5 : 11 ) On the other hand , the tri@@ bes of Re@@ u@@ b@@ en , Dan , and A@@ sh@@ er were each sing@@ led out at Judges 5 : 15-@@ 17 for giving more attention to their own material interests — as re@@ presented by their flo@@ cks , ships , and har@@ bor@@ s — than to the work that Jehovah was having done .
( Mark 8 : 15 ) That re@@ feren@@ ce to Her@@ od likely re@@ f@@ ers to the par@@ ty followers of Her@@ od .
As we endure the trial , we will learn to show these qualities even more , and in that way we will improve our Christian personality .
17 Su@@ b@@ mit@@ ting to Jesus ’ teachings as his disciples will give our life real meaning and satisfac@@ tion .
Being “ a comple@@ ment ” of him , she would be “ a help@@ er for him ” as they daily brought happiness to each other by fulfill@@ ing their ro@@ les as husband and wife .
