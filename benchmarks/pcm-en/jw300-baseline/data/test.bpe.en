I asked one of the little gir@@ ls , H@@ il@@ da , if she wanted to come and preach with us .
We b@@ ou@@ ght her a pair , and she came preaching with us .
She was about to leave for her assignment in E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , and she said : “ You don@@ ’@@ t recogni@@ ze me , do you ?
I am the little gir@@ l from P@@ as@@ ti@@ l@@ l@@ o who had no sho@@ es . ”

Later , he gave me strong counsel about being organized and said that he was disa@@ pp@@ ointed in me .
Father did not accept the truth when M@@ other and I did .
My de@@ ar wife , Ma@@ x@@ ine , died in 20@@ 11 .

The first article shows how our faith can grow and remain strong .
Let me explain what led to that conversa@@ tion .

Then a soldier wal@@ ked by , and the doctor y@@ el@@ led , “ Do something about this y@@ el@@ low co@@ ward ! ”
The soldier could see that the man was d@@ ru@@ n@@ k , so he told him , “ Go home and so@@ ber up ! ”
He o@@ w@@ ned two b@@ ar@@ ber@@ sho@@ ps in Wi@@ ch@@ it@@ a , and the doctor was one of his c@@ li@@ ents !
With my parents , going to a convention in Wi@@ ch@@ it@@ a in the 19@@ 40 ’ s

The brother also so@@ ld my car for $ 25 .
We were assigned to special pioneer in W@@ al@@ n@@ ut Ri@@ dge , Ar@@ k@@ ans@@ as .
Then in 196@@ 2 , we were th@@ ri@@ lled to receive an invitation to the 3@@ 7@@ th class of Gilead .
In the ministry in Na@@ i@@ ro@@ b@@ i with Mary and Chr@@ is K@@ an@@ a@@ i@@ y@@ a
So@@ on after , our first daughter , K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly , was born , and 17 months later , we had Steph@@ any .
We would also go cam@@ ping with them and would have very enjoy@@ able conversa@@ tions around the cam@@ p@@ fire .
We arrang@@ ed to have some who were in the full - time ministry stay in our home .
They were sho@@ cked and started to cry and said that they wanted to study .
With the help and direction of Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s organization , we did our best to raise them to love Jehovah .
On a later tri@@ p , K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly met one of his work@@ mates , B@@ ri@@ an L@@ le@@ well@@ y@@ n .
So they did stay free until they were at lea@@ st 23 .
At the same time , B@@ ri@@ an and K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly were invited to work at L@@ on@@ don Bethel and later were trans@@ fer@@ red to Mal@@ aw@@ i Bethel .
The day after we left for the Watchtower E@@ du@@ ca@@ tional C@@ enter in P@@ at@@ ter@@ son , L@@ in@@ da called to tell us that M@@ other had died .
N@@ ext , we taught the course in Z@@ im@@ b@@ ab@@ we and then in Z@@ am@@ bi@@ a .

Since my mind is main@@ ly involved in an int@@ el@@ le@@ c@@ tu@@ al exercise , my heart is not necess@@ ar@@ ily tou@@ ched by the spiritual thoughts I am reading .
That is why I regularly set a@@ side time to study the Bible and other publications in my mother t@@ ong@@ ue . ”

( Read Luke 21 : 1 - 4 ; 2 Corinthians 8 : 12 . )
( Read Revelation 2 : 18 , 19 . )

and the brochure Who Are Do@@ ing Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Will Today ?
What are some reasons why we should be than@@ k@@ ful to Jehovah ?
There are many reasons why we should be than@@ k@@ ful to Jehovah !
It also shows how the hope of a reward benefits us .
I was only eight years old at the time .
My father did not want my mother to talk to me about what she was learning .
However , I was cu@@ ri@@ ous and asked questions , so she stu@@ died with me when my father was out of the house .
As a result , I too decided that I wanted to dedi@@ c@@ ate my life to Jehovah .
My mother said that I should first speak to the servant to the bre@@ thre@@ n ( now called a circuit overseer ) .
He said , “ Go for it ! ”
After four months , I sele@@ cted a brother as my pioneer part@@ ner .
My mother pi@@ on@@ ee@@ red with a sister in another congregation .
In 195@@ 1 , I filled out an app@@ li@@ cation to attend the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead .
While there , I received my invitation to the 2@@ 2@@ nd class of Gilead .
I then travel@@ ed by train to South L@@ ans@@ ing , New York , where the school was lo@@ cated .

We still serve at the branch office in Que@@ z@@ on City
How can you experience “ the peace of God ” ?
How can the congregation help you to re@@ duce anxiety ?
( See op@@ ening picture . ) ( b ) What will we consider in this article ?
How , though , can you do that ?
The psalmist David beg@@ ged Jehovah : “ L@@ ist@@ en to my prayer , O God . ”
When we are anx@@ ious , why is prayer so important ?
( Read Matthew 11 : 28 - 30 . )
What did Jesus mean when he said : “ N@@ ever be anx@@ ious ” ?
( See the box “ Some P@@ rac@@ tical W@@ a@@ ys to Re@@ duce An@@ x@@ i@@ ety . ” )
How can the meaning of Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s name strengthen your faith ?
His very name is understood to mean “ He C@@ au@@ ses to Be@@ come . ”
“ An@@ x@@ i@@ ety in a man@@ ’@@ s heart we@@ igh@@ s it down , but a good word che@@ ers it up . ”
Why can you be confident that your relationship with God will strengthen you ?
( a ) How can we th@@ row our anxiety on God ?
How can we be sure that Jehovah rewar@@ ds his servants ?
How did Jehovah bless his servants in the past ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) How are love and faith conne@@ cted ?
( b ) What questions will we consider ?
How , though , does the hope of a reward benefit us ?
Jesus showed that his disciples would be rewar@@ ded for their sacrifi@@ ces ( See paragraph 5 )
The apostle Peter once asked Jesus : “ We have left all things and followed you ; what , then , will there be for us ? ”
In the Ser@@ mon on the M@@ ount , Jesus said : “ Re@@ jo@@ ice and be over@@ joy@@ ed , since your reward is great in the heaven@@ s , for in that way they persecu@@ ted the prophe@@ ts pri@@ or to you . ”
Moses told the nation of Israel : “ Jehovah will su@@ rely bless you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to posse@@ ss as an inher@@ it@@ ance , but only if you stri@@ ctly obey the voice of Jehovah your God and care@@ fully observe all this command@@ ment that I am giving you today .
For Jehovah your God will bless you just as he has promised you . ”
And he named the second one Eph@@ ra@@ im , for he said , ‘ God has made me fruit@@ ful in the land of my af@@ fli@@ ction . ’ ”
Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s Word explains : “ For the joy that was set before him he en@@ du@@ red a t@@ or@@ ture st@@ ake , de@@ spi@@ sing shame . ”
Jesus certainly found joy in being able to sancti@@ fy Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s name .
How does Jehovah feel about what we do for him ?
“ The one showing favor to the low@@ ly is l@@ ending to Jehovah , and He will rep@@ ay him for what he does . ”
What comfort do we find at 1 John 3 : 19 , 20 ?
( Read 1 John 3 : 19 , 20 . )
What are some of the rewar@@ ds that we enjoy now ?
How do Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s servants feel about the rewar@@ ds they receive ?
For example , Bi@@ an@@ ca from Germany says : “ I cannot thank Jehovah enough for helping me with my wor@@ ries and for being at my side each day .
The world out there is cha@@ o@@ tic and ble@@ ak .
But as I work clo@@ sely with Jehovah , I feel se@@ cure in his ar@@ ms .
Wh@@ en@@ ever I make personal sacrifi@@ ces for him , he gives me back a hundre@@ d@@ fo@@ ld in blessings . ”
For my own encouragement , I keep a no@@ te@@ book with scriptu@@ res and thoughts from our publications that I can con@@ sul@@ t from time to time .
I call it ‘ My S@@ ur@@ vi@@ val No@@ te@@ book . ’
D@@ is@@ coura@@ gement is temp@@ or@@ ary if we focus on Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s promises .
Jehovah is always there to help us , regar@@ d@@ less of our circumstances . ”
Yet , you can likely think of ways in which Jehovah has rewar@@ ded you and those around you .
How were Paul and others set free from sin and death ?
( Read Romans 6 : 1 , 2 . )
What choice does each of us have to make ?
He wrote : “ I am fle@@ shly , so@@ ld under sin .
( Read Romans 7 : 21 - 23 . )
( Read Proverbs 14 : 5 ; Ephesians 4 : 25 . )
They receive “ the spirit ” as ones “ wa@@ iting for a@@ do@@ p@@ tion as sons , the release from [ their fle@@ shly ] bo@@ dies . ”
( Read Romans 4 : 20 - 22 . )
( Read Acts 18 : 2 - 4 ; 20 : 20 , 21 , 34 , 35 . )
Many tou@@ ri@@ sts come to the city of A@@ ve@@ ir@@ o in nor@@ thern P@@ or@@ tu@@ gal to see the interest@@ ing sal@@ t ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ation p@@ on@@ ds .
L@@ oc@@ al Witnesses make sure to offer the good news to those who sell the lo@@ cally produ@@ ced sal@@ t
In this article , we will learn how to treasure Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s gift of free will by using it in a way that ple@@ ases the Gi@@ ver of that gift .
The first article explains what modesty is and what it is not .
How does Jehovah expect us to use our ab@@ ilities ?
Clearly , Jehovah wants us to do what we can to benefit ourselves and others .
Noah lived in a world that was “ filled with violence ” and immorality .
O@@ pp@@ o@@ sition to our preaching ( See paragraphs 6 - 9 )
6 , 7 . ( a ) What could Noah not do ?
( b ) How are we in a situation similar to No@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s ?
We too live in a world filled with wi@@ c@@ ke@@ dness , which we know Jehovah has promised to destroy .
In the mean@@ time , we cannot force people to accept the “ good news of the Kingdom . ”
What Noah could do : Instead of giving up because of what he could not do , Noah focused on what he could do .
When that happened , how did David react ?
Pa@@ st sins ( See paragraphs 11 - 14 )
11 , 12 . ( a ) After he sin@@ ned , what could David not do ?
What David could not do : David could not un@@ do what he had done .
He had to trust that when he truly rep@@ en@@ ted , Jehovah would forgive him and help him endure the consequences of his actions .
( Read James 5 : 14 - 16 . )
He had to leave the matter in Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s hands .
( Read Luke 21 : 1 - 4 . )
Consider a brother named Mal@@ col@@ m , who re@@ mained faithful until his death in 2015 .
F@@ oc@@ us on what you can do , not on what you cannot do . ”

Imagine that you gave a valuable gift to a friend .
What is one way we can avoid mi@@ su@@ sing our Christian freedom ?
( Read 1 Peter 2 : 16 . )
It does not bel@@ ong to man who is walking even to direct his st@@ ep . ”
What do we learn from the princi@@ ple found at G@@ al@@ a@@ ti@@ ans 6 : 5 ?
Remember the princi@@ ple found at G@@ al@@ a@@ ti@@ ans 6 : 5 .
How will you show that you treasure your gift of free will ?

What is modesty , and what is it not ?
Why should we avoid jud@@ ging other pe@@ op@@ le@@ ’@@ s mo@@ tives ?
What can we learn from Jesus ’ example when we receive a change of assignment ?
( Read G@@ al@@ a@@ ti@@ ans 6 : 4 , 5 . )
( Read Proverbs 3 : 5 , 6 . )
( Read Ec@@ cle@@ si@@ a@@ st@@ es 11 : 4 - 6 . )
What will help us to remain modest forever ?
Why is it difficult for some to d@@ ele@@ g@@ ate authority ?
He told Nathan to tell David : “ You are not the one who will build the house for me to d@@ well in . ”
( Read N@@ u@@ mbers 11 : 24 - 29 . )
No , I wish that all of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s people were prophe@@ ts and that Jehovah would put his spirit on them ! ”
( Read Philippians 2 : 20 - 22 . )
The branch office sent us 8@@ 00 magaz@@ ines to use in the ministry .
I taught clas@@ ses in M@@ an@@ a@@ us , B@@ el@@ é@@ m , F@@ or@@ tal@@ e@@ z@@ a , Re@@ ci@@ fe , and S@@ al@@ v@@ ad@@ or .
We arrived in Li@@ s@@ b@@ on , P@@ or@@ tu@@ gal , in Au@@ g@@ ust of 196@@ 4 .
It is the only one doing the work Jesus comman@@ ded his disciples to do ​ — preach the good news of Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s Kingdom ! ”
While this article was being pre@@ pared for publi@@ cation , D@@ ou@@ gl@@ as G@@ u@@ est died faithful to Jehovah on O@@ c@@ to@@ ber 25 , 2015 .
( Read Isaiah 6@@ 3 : 11 - 14 . )
And “ the spirit of Jehovah began to em@@ power David . ”
Why did God want his people to respect the leaders in Israel ?
( Read Hebrews 1 : 7 , 14 . )
The Bible re@@ f@@ ers to the Law given to Israel as “ the Law of Moses . ”
11 , 12 . ( a ) What were Joshua and the kings who ru@@ led Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s people required to do ?
“ As soon as the king heard the words of the book of the Law , he ri@@ pped his gar@@ ments a@@ part . ”
Why did Jehovah discipline some of the leaders of his people ?
In some cases , Jehovah discipl@@ ined or re@@ placed those leaders .
What proved that Jesus was em@@ po@@ wered by holy spirit ?
S@@ hor@@ tly after Jesus was baptized , “ angels came and began to minist@@ er to him . ”
H@@ ours before his death , “ an angel from heaven appe@@ a@@ red to him and strengthened him . ”
How did Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s Word guide Jesus ’ life and teaching ?
It is in va@@ in that they keep worshipp@@ ing me , for they teach comm@@ ands of men as do@@ ct@@ r@@ ines . ”
No@@ body is good ex@@ ce@@ pt one , God . ”
“ In@@ stan@@ tly the angel of Jehovah stru@@ ck him , because he did not give the glory to God , and he was e@@ at@@ en up with wor@@ ms and died . ”
What will we discuss in the next article ?
The next article will consider the answers to those questions .
This may have been the original do@@ cu@@ ment written by Moses .
Why was this sele@@ ction so important to them and to Jehovah ?
As a governing body , they gave direction to all the congregations . ​ — Acts 15 : 2 .
5 , 6 . ( a ) How did holy spirit em@@ power the governing body ?
( c ) How did Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s Word guide the governing body ?
First , holy spirit em@@ po@@ wered the governing body .
Th@@ ird , Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s Word gui@@ ded the governing body .
Why can we say that Jesus led the early Christians ?
( a ) When did Jesus app@@ o@@ int “ the faithful and dis@@ cre@@ et slave ” ?
In 1919 , three years after Brother Rus@@ sel@@ l@@ ’@@ s death , Jesus appointed “ the faithful and dis@@ cre@@ et slave . ”
The July 15 , 20@@ 13 , issue of The Watchtower explained that “ the faithful and dis@@ cre@@ et slave ” is a small group of anointed brothers who make up the Governing Body .
So how can we answer Jesus ’ question : “ Who really is the faithful and dis@@ cre@@ et slave ? ”
How has holy spirit helped the Governing Body ?
( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 10 . )
( Read Revelation 14 : 6 , 7 . )
What is one way to remember the Governing Body ?
Why are you determined to follow our Lea@@ der , Jesus ?
When Jesus returned to heaven , he did not ab@@ an@@ don his followers .
So@@ on , he will lead us to everlasting life .
Since 195@@ 5 , that cor@@ por@@ ation has been known as the Watch Tower Bible and T@@ r@@ act Soci@@ ety of P@@ en@@ n@@ s@@ yl@@ v@@ ani@@ a .
Jehovah “ com@@ forts us in all our trials ”
“ I have spo@@ ken , and I will bring it about .
1 , 2 . ( a ) What has Jehovah reve@@ aled to us ?
THE very first words of the Bible make this simple but pro@@ found st@@ at@@ ement : “ In the beginning God created the heaven@@ s and the earth . ”
( c ) What questions will we consider ?
And why is Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice the key that un@@ lo@@ cks the door for Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s purpose to be accompli@@ shed ?
What are some gifts that Jehovah gave Adam and Eve ?
But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad , you must not eat from it , for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die . ”
It was as if he were saying : ‘ You mean you cannot do what you want ? ’
But Jehovah is faithful to his own standards ; he never viol@@ ates them .
( Read Deuteronomy 32 : 4 , 5 . )
Why is the ransom such a precious gift ?
Jehovah provided the ransom at great cost to himself .
When will Jehovah become “ all things to everyone ” ?
Let your will take place , as in heaven , also on earth . ”
( Read Psalm 40 : 8 - 10 . )
How can we show that we love Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s name ?
( Read 1 Peter 1 : 15 , 16 . )
Why can Jehovah view us as righteous , even though we are imperfect ?
He accep@@ ts as his worshippers those who dedi@@ c@@ ate themselves to him .
What did Jesus mean when he next said : “ Let your will take place ” ?
How does the ransom benefit humans who have died ?
What is Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s will for the “ great crow@@ d ” ?
( a ) What blessings do we now receive from Jehovah ?
( Read Acts 3 : 19 - 21 . )
“ We have come to know and believe the love that God has for us .
And should we at times change a decision that we have made ?
This article will help us to answer those questions .
Yet , Jehovah vie@@ wed those kings as having a complete heart .
Will God view us as having a complete heart , despite mistakes we make ?
We lived on a small farm in ea@@ st@@ er@@ n South Da@@ k@@ o@@ t@@ a .
F@@ ar@@ ming was an important part of our fam@@ il@@ y@@ ’@@ s life , but it was not the most important part .
My parents got baptized as Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses in 19@@ 34 .
My d@@ ad , C@@ la@@ ren@@ ce , and later my un@@ c@@ le Al@@ f@@ red , served as comp@@ any servant ( now called co@@ ord@@ in@@ ator of the body of elders ) in our small congregation in Con@@ de , South Da@@ k@@ o@@ t@@ a .
My sister , D@@ or@@ o@@ thy , and I became Kingdom publishers when we were six .
Con@@ ven@@ tions and as@@ semb@@ lies were an important part of our lives .
The Bible says : “ The one walking with the wise will become wise , ” and there were many wise ones in my family who suppor@@ ted my decision to pioneer .
When they were serving congregations ne@@ ar@@ by , they sometimes invited me to go with them in the ministry .
As a new Beth@@ el@@ ite , with a farm tru@@ ck
The farm on St@@ at@@ en Is@@ land included the ra@@ di@@ o st@@ ation W@@ B@@ B@@ R .
On@@ ly 15 to 20 members of the Bethel family were assigned to the farm .
Most of us were young and quite in@@ experienced .
Brother Pe@@ ter@@ son did his work at Bethel well but never ne@@ g@@ le@@ cted the field ministry .
With An@@ g@@ el@@ a in 197@@ 5 , before a t@@ el@@ evi@@ sion inter@@ view
Th@@ re@@ e years later , we were invited to Bethel .
Why do Jehovah and Christ de@@ serve to be hon@@ o@@ red ?
H@@ u@@ mans were created “ in Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s i@@ mage . ”
8 , 9 . ( a ) How do Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses view government of@@ fici@@ als ?
( Read 1 Timothy 5 : 17 . )
Moreover , do not call anyone your father on earth , for one is your Father , the heavenly One .
Ne@@ ither be called leaders , for your Lea@@ der is one , the Christ .
But the greatest one among you must be your minist@@ er .
W@@ ho@@ ever ex@@ al@@ ts himself will be hu@@ mb@@ led , and who@@ ever hu@@ mb@@ les himself will be ex@@ al@@ ted . ”
( Read Hebrews 13 : 7 , 17 . )
Why should others not make decisions for us ?
( a ) To make wise decisions , we should have faith in what ?
What will help us to make wise decisions ?
( Read James 1 : 5 - 8 . )
( Read 2 Corinthians 1 : 24 . )
Lo@@ ving elders help others learn to make their own decisions ( See paragraph 11 )
Elders too should take time to do research .
Will it bring joy and peace to my family ?
And will it show that I am patient and kind ? ’
Why does Jehovah expect us to make our own decisions ?
What does it mean to serve Jehovah with a complete heart ?
Which of the four kings would you like to imitate , and why ?
( Read 2 Chr@@ onic@@ les 14 : 11 . )
What would your heart move you to do ?
A@@ sa@@ ’@@ s son Jehoshaphat “ kept walking in the way of his father Asa . ”
( Read 2 Chr@@ onic@@ les 20 : 2 - 4 . )
( Read Isaiah 37 : 15 - 20 . )
( Read 2 K@@ ings 20 : 1 - 3 . )
( Read 2 Chr@@ onic@@ les 34 : 1 - 3 . )
( Read 2 Chr@@ onic@@ les 34 : 18 , 19 . )

( Read 2 Chr@@ onic@@ les 16 : 7 - 9 . )
( Read 2 Chr@@ onic@@ les 32 : 31 . )
Many praise him for what he has done .
( Read 2 Chr@@ onic@@ les 35 : 20 - 22 . )
The Bible says that Ne@@ cho@@ ’@@ s words were “ from the mouth of God . ”
Let us meditate on these Bible accounts and be than@@ k@@ ful that Jehovah has provided them for us !
How many vo@@ ws have you made to Jehovah ?
What about your dedication vow or your marriage vow ?
When we believe that we have personally experienced or ob@@ served an injustice , our faith , humility , and loy@@ alty may be te@@ sted .
“ The world is pas@@ sing away and so is its desire , but the one who does the will of God re@@ main@@ s forever . ” ​ — 1 JO@@ H@@ N 2 : 17 .
What will Jehovah do about wicked people and corru@@ pt organiz@@ ations ?
The Bible says : “ The world is pas@@ sing away . ”
There is no d@@ ar@@ k@@ ness or deep sha@@ d@@ ow where wrong@@ do@@ ers can con@@ ce@@ al themselves . ”
Later in the same p@@ salm , we read : “ The righteous will posse@@ ss the earth , and they will live forever on it . ”
Who are “ the mee@@ k ” and “ the righteous ” ?
Why can we be sure that the new earth will be well - organized ?
After Arma@@ ge@@ ddon , will there be any organization on earth ?
So the “ new earth ” will be organized .
What kind of wrong activities are common where you live , and how are you and your family affe@@ cted ?
What do we learn from Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s judgment of So@@ dom and Go@@ mor@@ r@@ ah ?
( Read 2 Peter 2 : 6 - 8 . )
( Read Psalm 46 : 8 , 9 . )
What are some things that will be g@@ one forever after Arma@@ ge@@ ddon ?
I@@ l@@ lu@@ strate . ( b ) How can we be sure that we will remain after this old world is g@@ one ?
“ WI@@ LL the Ju@@ dge of all the earth not do what is right ? ”
Because Jehovah is the greatest example of justice and righteousness .
Christians expect to experience some injustice outside the Christian congregation .
In 194@@ 6 , he atten@@ ded the e@@ igh@@ th class of Gilead School in New York , U.S@@ .@@ A .
After gradu@@ ation , he was eventually assigned to the circuit work in S@@ wit@@ z@@ er@@ land .
What examples will we consider in this article and in the next ?
In this article , we will consider Ab@@ ra@@ ha@@ m@@ ’@@ s great - grand@@ son Joseph and his experience with his brothers .
10 , 11 . ( a ) What in@@ justi@@ ces did Joseph experience ?
( Read Matthew 5 : 23 , 24 ; 18 : 15 . )
Lo@@ y@@ alty to Jehovah and to our brothers will protect us from making such a mistake .
Most important , he did not allow the im@@ perfe@@ ctions and wrong actions of others to separate him from Jehovah .
Why should we draw even closer to Jehovah if we experience injustice in the congregation ?
How can we show that we have confidence in “ the Ju@@ dge of all the earth ” ?
What will we consider in the next article ?
See W@@ ill@@ i Di@@ e@@ h@@ l@@ ’@@ s life story , “ Jehovah Is My God , in W@@ ho@@ m I Will Tru@@ st , ” in the November 1 , 199@@ 1 , issue of The Watchtower .

Jephthah said : “ I have op@@ ened my mouth to Jehovah , and I am un@@ able to turn back . ”
( b ) What did Hann@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s vow mean for Samuel ?
She took Samuel to High Pri@@ est El@@ i at the tabernacle in Sh@@ il@@ oh and said : “ It was for this boy that I pray@@ ed , and Jehovah gran@@ ted my pe@@ ti@@ tion that I asked of him .
The second most important vow that a person can make is the marriage vow .
What does the Bible say about di@@ vor@@ ce and separ@@ ation ?
( Read 1 Corinthians 7 : 10 , 11 . )
One couple said : “ Since we have been stu@@ dying this brochure , our marriage has been happ@@ i@@ er than ever . ”
We are doing much better now as a couple . ”
18 , 19 . ( a ) What have many Christian parents done ?
( b ) What can be said about those who are in special full - time service ?
S@@ pe@@ ci@@ al full - time service vow ( See paragraph 19 )

Naboth was faithful to Jehovah at a time when most Israelites were following the bad example of King Ahab and his wife , wicked Qu@@ een Je@@ ze@@ bel .
Read 1 K@@ ings 21 : 1 - 3 .
He respect@@ fully explained : “ It is un@@ th@@ in@@ k@@ able , from Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s stand@@ point , for me to give you the inher@@ it@@ ance of my fore@@ fa@@ thers . ”
Why would humility have been a protection to N@@ abo@@ th@@ ’@@ s family and friends ?
( Read Deuteronomy 32 : 3 , 4 . )
( b ) In what ways will humility protect us ?
How will you respond if the elders ann@@ oun@@ ce a decision that you do not agree with ?
What account will we now consider , and why ?
How was Peter cor@@ re@@ cted , and what questions ar@@ ise ?
In fact , he was later inspired to write two le@@ tters that became part of the Bible .
3 Hel@@ ping “ F@@ o@@ re@@ ign Re@@ si@@ dents ” to “ Ser@@ ve Jehovah With Re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing ”
The second article consi@@ ders how app@@ lying Bible principles will help im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant parents to make decisions that will benefit their children .

How did Jesus and many of his disciples become refugees ?
He said : “ When they persecu@@ te you in one city , fle@@ e to another . ”
( b ) are living in a camp ?
My fe@@ et were so s@@ w@@ ol@@ l@@ en that I told my family to go on without me .
My father ​ — not about to ab@@ an@@ don me to the re@@ bel for@@ ces — ​ car@@ ried me .
They go@@ ssi@@ p@@ ed , d@@ ran@@ k , g@@ am@@ b@@ led , sto@@ le , and were immor@@ al . ”
( Read 1 John 3 : 17 , 18 . )
( b ) Why do they need our patient help ?
They need to see that we care about them .
( b ) How can refugees show gra@@ titude ?
How can we help our brothers and sisters who are refugees ?
( a ) What temp@@ tation do refugees need to re@@ sist ?
Fin@@ ally , he held up the emp@@ ty ba@@ g and said with a smile : ‘ You see ?
This is all you need ! ’ ” ​ — Read 1 Timothy 6 : 8 .
They need to sense Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s love and compassion among their fellow Christians .
Many of to@@ da@@ y@@ ’@@ s refugees come from coun@@ tries where our preaching work is rest@@ ri@@ cted .
( b ) What will we consider in the following article ?
She said : “ The brothers there tre@@ ated them like close relatives , provi@@ ding food , clo@@ th@@ es , s@@ hel@@ ter , and tran@@ sp@@ ort@@ ation .
Who else would welcome strangers into their home just because they worship the same God ?
On@@ ly Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses ! ” ​ — Read John 13 : 35 .
As soon as possible after a refugee arri@@ ves , elders should follow the direction in O@@ r@@ ganiz@@ ed to Do Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Will , chapter 8 , paragraph 30 .
In the mean@@ time , they can ask dis@@ cre@@ et questions about a refu@@ ge@@ e@@ ’@@ s congregation and ministry to discer@@ n his spiritual condition .

“ But after I started school , I began to pre@@ fer the local language .
Wi@@ th@@ in a few years , the shi@@ ft was complete .
I cou@@ ld@@ n@@ ’@@ t understand the meetings , and I di@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t identi@@ fy with my parents ’ culture . ”
3 , 4 . ( a ) How can parents set a good example for their children ?
( b ) What should parents not expect of their children ?
When your children see you “ seeking first the Kingdom , ” they learn to dep@@ end on Jehovah for their daily needs .
N@@ ever get so bus@@ y that you do not have time for your children .
How may your children benefit from learning your language ?
Parents , if that descri@@ bes your children , can you learn at lea@@ st some of the local language ?
A child who comm@@ uni@@ c@@ ates best in another spo@@ ken language de@@ serves the same concern , would you not agree ?
If that is your situation , you can still help your children to come to know and love Jehovah .
“ But when we saw her stu@@ dying , praying , and doing her best to conduct family worship every week , we understood that getting to know Jehovah was very important . ”
How can parents help children who may need to study in two languages ?
( a ) Who must decide which language congregation to attend ?
That may not be the case when children do not fully understand the language .
( Read 1 Corinthians 14 : 9 , 11 . )
The answer was not what we personally found conven@@ i@@ ent .
But when we saw that they were getting little benefit from the meetings in our language , we decided to move to the local - language congregation .
To@@ gether , we regularly atten@@ ded meetings and sha@@ red in the ministry .
We also invited local friends to join us for me@@ als and ex@@ cur@@ sions .
All of this helped our children to get to know the brothers and to get to know Jehovah , not only as their God but also as their Father and Fri@@ end .
We considered this to be much more important than their ma@@ st@@ ering our language . ”
Samuel ad@@ ds : “ To keep ourselves spiritually strong , my wife and I also atten@@ ded meetings in our language .
Life was very bus@@ y , and we were ti@@ red .
But we thank Jehovah for blessing our efforts and sacrifi@@ ces .
Our three children are all serving Jehovah in the full - time ministry . ”
“ I knew the ba@@ si@@ cs of my parents ’ language , but the language spo@@ ken at the meetings was over my head , ” rec@@ alls K@@ ri@@ st@@ ina .
“ When I was 12 , I atten@@ ded a convention in my school language .
For the first time , I understood that what I was hear@@ ing was the truth !
Another tur@@ ning point came when I began to pray in my school language .
I could speak to Jehovah from my heart ! ”
Young people , do you think that you would pre@@ fer being part of a local - language congregation ?
“ When my si@@ bl@@ ings and I got into our te@@ ens , we wanted to s@@ wit@@ ch to the local - language congregation , ” says Na@@ dia , who now serves at Bethel .
“ Now we@@ ’@@ re grateful that our parents worked hard to teach us their language and kept us in the foreign - language congregation .
It has en@@ ri@@ ched our lives and bro@@ a@@ den@@ ed our opportunities to help others get to know Jehovah . ”
( b ) How can parents get help in teaching their children the truth ?
( Read Proverbs 1 : 8 ; 31 : 10 , 27 , 28 . )
Still , parents who do not know the local language may need help to reach their chil@@ d@@ ren@@ ’@@ s heart .
Bo@@ th children and parents benefit from associ@@ ation with the congregation ( See paragraphs 18 , 19 )
( b ) What must parents continue to do ?
“ When they helped me with student talk assign@@ ments for the meeting , I always learned more .
And I enjoyed the le@@ i@@ sure activities we sha@@ red in as a group . ”
Parents , pray to Jehovah for help , and try your best .
( Read 2 Chr@@ onic@@ les 15 : 7 . )
P@@ ut your chil@@ d@@ ’@@ s friendship with Jehovah ahead of your own interests .
But it w@@ as@@ n@@ ’@@ t until 194@@ 6 that I really understood Bible truth .

When she wanted to get baptized , her parents told her , “ Be@@ come one of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , and you will have to leave our home ! ”
She continued her study and later got baptized .
When we got married in 196@@ 0 , her parents did not come to our we@@ d@@ ding .

How can we keep our love for Jehovah strong ?
How can we deep@@ en our love for Bible truth ?
Why is it important to have affection for our brothers ?
What may have cau@@ sed the love of some Christians to grow cold ?
People today have less and less love for God .
This is the greatest and first command@@ ment . ”
S@@ how love for Jehovah ( See paragraph 10 )
( Read Psalm 119 : 9@@ 7 - 100 . )
S@@ how love for Bible truth ( See paragraph 14 )
On his last night on earth , Jesus said to his disciples : “ I am giving you a new command@@ ment , that you love one another ; just as I have loved you , you also love one another .
By this all will know that you are my disciples ​ — if you have love among y@@ ourselves . ” ​ — John 13 : 34 , 35 .
The apostle John wrote : “ The one who does not love his brother , whom he has seen , cannot love God , whom he has not seen . ”
S@@ how love for the brothers and sisters ( See paragraph 17 )
What are some ways in which we can show love ?
Read 1 The@@ ss@@ al@@ oni@@ ans 4 : 9 , 10 .
“ Sim@@ on son of John , do you love me more than these ? ” ​ — JO@@ H@@ N 21 : 15 .
Then he said to them : “ ‘ Ca@@ st the n@@ et on the right side of the boat and you will find some . ’
So they ca@@ st it , but they were not able to ha@@ u@@ l it in because of the large number of fish . ” ​ — John 21 : 1 - 6 .
( b ) What valuable lesson did a brother in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and learn about his work ?
As a result , it left me almost no time for spiritual matters .
I fin@@ ally realized that in order to put Kingdom interests first , I needed to change my line of work . ”
“ After plan@@ ning for about a year , ” he explained , “ I decided to become a stre@@ et ven@@ d@@ or and sell ice cre@@ am .
In the beginning , I strugg@@ led fin@@ anci@@ ally and got discoura@@ ged .
When I met my former work@@ mates , they would laugh at me and ask why I thought sel@@ ling ice cre@@ am was better than working with com@@ pu@@ ters in an a@@ ir - con@@ di@@ tioned en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment .
I pray@@ ed to Jehovah , asking him to help me to cope and to reach my goal of having more time for spiritual activities .
I got better ac@@ qu@@ a@@ inted with my custo@@ m@@ ers ’ ta@@ st@@ es and became more sk@@ ill@@ ful in making ice cre@@ am .
So@@ on , I was sel@@ ling all my ice cre@@ am every day .
Ac@@ tually , I was better - off fin@@ anci@@ ally than when I worked with com@@ pu@@ ters .
It has made me happ@@ i@@ er because I do not have the stre@@ ss and worry that I had with my former jo@@ b .
And most important , I now feel closer to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Matthew 5 : 3 , 6 .
After his baptism , he said : “ The only regret I have is that I lost so much time before I realized that serving Jehovah brings far more happiness than pur@@ su@@ ing the entertainment offered by this world . ”
Jesus said : “ Where your treasure is , there your heart will be also . ”
Jesus stated that “ no one can slave for two ma@@ st@@ ers . ”
He added : “ You cannot slave for God and for Ri@@ ches . ”
( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 14 . )
See the article “ Is Your Re@@ creation B@@ ene@@ ficial ? ”
We also sha@@ red regularly in the field ministry . ”
We were so sa@@ d to leave our Bible students behind . ”

“ Where your treasure is , there your hearts will be also . ” ​ — L@@ U@@ KE 12 : 34 .
As we do so , meditate on how you personally can deep@@ en your love for these spiritual trea@@ sures .
Can you imagine how precious that pe@@ ar@@ l was to him ?
( Read Mark 10 : 28 - 30 . )
( a ) Why did the apostle Paul descri@@ be our ministry as a “ treasure in ear@@ then ve@@ s@@ sel@@ s ” ?
( Read Romans 1 : 14 , 15 ; 2 Timothy 4 : 2 . )
Some of them serve as Beth@@ el@@ ites , pioneers , and elders .
I@@ ren@@ e says , “ When I think of other goals I could have pur@@ su@@ ed , I can@@ ’@@ t imagine one that would have brought me more joy . ”
What is the “ treasure st@@ ore ” that Jesus refer@@ red to at Matthew 13 : 52 , and how do we f@@ ill it ?
( Read Proverbs 2 : 4 - 7 . )
Consider the experience of a brother named Peter .
To test Peter , the ra@@ b@@ b@@ i asked , “ So , my boy , what language was the book of Daniel written in ? ”
When I went home and che@@ cked the Watchtower and Awake !
magaz@@ ines from the pre@@ vi@@ ous months , I found an article expla@@ ining that Daniel was written in A@@ ra@@ ma@@ ic . ”
As you do this , you will build up “ treasure in the heaven@@ s , where no thief ge@@ ts near and no mo@@ th con@@ su@@ mes .
For where your treasure is , there your hearts will be also . ” ​ — Luke 12 : 33 , 34 .
“ I had trouble getting along with a brother who worked with me .

“ I was on a three - person phone call .
One of the others said good - b@@ y@@ e , and I thought he was off the line .
I then said un@@ kind things about him to the other person on the phone , but the first person had not hun@@ g up . ” ​ — MI@@ CH@@ A@@ E@@ L .
“ In our congregation , two pioneers began having problems .
Their bi@@ ck@@ ering was discoura@@ ging to others . ” ​ — G@@ ARY .
“ Do not become up@@ set with one another on the way . ”
“ Pl@@ ans fail when there is no con@@ sul@@ tation . ”
Mic@@ ha@@ el says , “ My brother genu@@ in@@ ely for@@ gave me . ”
“ Continue putting up with one another and for@@ giving one another fre@@ ely even if anyone has a cause for com@@ pla@@ int against another . ”
Now they get along well as they preach the good news .
That differen@@ ce may seem un@@ important ; yet , it can lead to serious problems . ”
As my ir@@ rit@@ ation gre@@ w , I started being cur@@ t with her .
I thought , ‘ She does not show me the respect I de@@ serve , so I am not going to show her respect . ’ ”
“ I began see@@ ing my own personality f@@ laws , and I was very disa@@ pp@@ ointed in myself .
I realized that I had to ad@@ just my thinking .
After praying to Jehovah about the matter , I b@@ ou@@ ght the sister a small gift and wrote her a c@@ ard to a@@ po@@ lo@@ gi@@ ze for my bad attitude .
We hu@@ g@@ ged each other and a@@ gre@@ ed to put the matter behind us .
We have not had any more problems . ”
FOR many people today , money is the big issue .
Why must the issue of sovereignty be sett@@ led ?
How important is the v@@ indi@@ cation of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s sovereignty ?
Why , from the day our fore@@ fa@@ thers f@@ ell as@@ le@@ ep in death , all things are continu@@ ing ex@@ ac@@ tly as they were from c@@ rea@@ tion@@ ’@@ s beginning . ”
( Read Isaiah 55 : 10 , 11 . )
( Read Job 1 : 7 - 12 . )
( Read Job 38 : 18 - 21 . )
( Read Romans 5 : 3 - 5 . )
One reason is that he ru@@ les with love .
He ca@@ res for us better than we can care for ourselves .

“ Make friends for y@@ ourselves by means of the un@@ righteous riches . ” ​ — L@@ U@@ KE 16 : 9 .
How can we avoid becoming sla@@ ves of to@@ da@@ y@@ ’@@ s comm@@ erci@@ al world ?
In this system of things , why will there always be some poor people ?
What can we learn from Jesus ’ counsel ?
How do we know that to@@ da@@ y@@ ’@@ s comm@@ erci@@ al system was not part of Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s purpose ?
Give examples of how some are showing faith@@ fulness in their use of un@@ righteous riches .
I am more gener@@ ous in being for@@ giving , in being patient with others , and in being able to accept disa@@ pp@@ o@@ int@@ ments and counsel . ”
( Read 2 Corinthians 8 : 13 - 15 . )
How did Abraham show that he tru@@ sted in God ?

If you are gri@@ ev@@ ing , you too can find so@@ o@@ thing comfort from such scriptu@@ res as the following :
( Read 1 The@@ ss@@ al@@ oni@@ ans 5 : 11 . )
What do we need to remember about gri@@ ef ?
Even when someone does express how he fe@@ els , it is not always easy for others to understand what he is tr@@ ying to say .
At that mo@@ ment , I don@@ ’@@ t feel quite so alone in my gri@@ ef . ”
“ Re@@ cei@@ ving a short encouraging message or an invitation to spend time with a fellow Christian helps me more than I can say , ” says J@@ uni@@ a .

“ Sometimes when sisters have come to comfort me , ” rec@@ alls D@@ al@@ en@@ e , “ I have asked them if they are willing to say a prayer .
They start praying , often batt@@ ling to speak at first , but every time , within a few sent@@ ences , their voice ge@@ ts str@@ ong@@ er and they say the most heartfelt prayer .
Their strong faith , their love , and their concern have been very faith - strength@@ ening . ”
“ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of distre@@ ss . ”
“ I expe@@ cted my first we@@ d@@ ding ann@@ i@@ vers@@ ary to be very tra@@ u@@ ma@@ tic , ” relates one brother , “ and it was not easy .
But a few brothers and sisters plan@@ ned a small ga@@ th@@ ering of my clo@@ se@@ st friends so that I w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n@@ ’@@ t be on my own . ”
“ O@@ f@@ ten the help and comp@@ ani@@ on@@ ship offered when there is no special ann@@ i@@ vers@@ ary can be very bene@@ ficial , ” explains J@@ uni@@ a .
“ Those spon@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ous mo@@ ments are so valuable and bring much comfort . ”
They have truly made me feel Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s loving ar@@ ms around me . ”
Why are Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s promises a source of great comfort ?
God promises that “ he will do away with death forever , and the So@@ vere@@ ign Lord Jehovah will wi@@ pe away the t@@ ears from all fac@@ es . ”
Other scriptu@@ res that many have found comfor@@ ting are Psalm 20 : 1 , 2 ; 31 : 7 ; 38 : 8 , 9 , 15 ; 55 : 22 ; 1@@ 21 : 1 , 2 ; Isaiah 5@@ 7 : 15 ; 6@@ 6 : 13 ; Philippians 4 : 13 ; and 1 Peter 5 : 7 .

What pl@@ ans can lead to a happy future for you ?
What could a life in the pioneer service lead to ?
YOU young ones will pro@@ b@@ ably agree that before star@@ ting a j@@ our@@ ney , it is wise to plan where you will go .
Life is like a j@@ our@@ ney , and the time to plan where you want to go is when you are young .
How do you know that Jehovah wants you to plan for a happy future ?
Your Creator is “ the God of love , ” “ the happy God , ” who made humans “ in his i@@ mage . ”
You will be happy when you imitate our loving God .
Jesus Christ set the perfect example for you young ones .
Jesus also dre@@ w close to Jehovah by stu@@ dying the Scriptures .
“ Pl@@ ans fail when there is no con@@ sul@@ tation , but there is accompli@@ sh@@ ment through many ad@@ vis@@ ers . ”
As with any care@@ er , you need time to become sk@@ illed .
At first , I cou@@ ld@@ n@@ ’@@ t start any Bible stu@@ dies , but later I moved to another territory , and within a month I started several stu@@ dies .
One student began coming to the Kingdom Hall .
For example , Jacob , from N@@ or@@ th A@@ mer@@ ic@@ a , wr@@ ites : “ When I was seven , many of my clas@@ s@@ mates were V@@ i@@ e@@ t@@ na@@ me@@ se .
I wanted to tell them about Jehovah , so after a while I made pl@@ ans to learn their language .
For the most part , I learned by com@@ par@@ ing the English and V@@ i@@ e@@ t@@ na@@ me@@ se e@@ ditions of The Watchtower .
I also made friends in a ne@@ ar@@ by V@@ i@@ e@@ t@@ na@@ me@@ se - language congregation .
When I was 18 , I started pioneering .
Later , I atten@@ ded the Bible School for S@@ ing@@ le Brothers .
This helped me with my present pioneer assignment , where I am the only elder in a V@@ i@@ e@@ t@@ na@@ me@@ se - language group .
Many V@@ i@@ e@@ t@@ na@@ me@@ se people are a@@ ma@@ zed that I have learned their language .
They invite me in , and often I can study the Bible with them .
Some have progre@@ ssed to baptism . ” ​ — Co@@ mp@@ are Acts 2 : 7 , 8 .
I enjoy encouraging the young brothers in our congregation and see@@ ing their spiritual progress .
After I atten@@ ded the Bible School for S@@ ing@@ le Brothers , I received a new pioneer assignment .
I@@ t@@ ’@@ s true that I have never found anyone in the territory who progre@@ ssed to baptism , but others have .
How may pioneer service lead to other opportunities ?
A brother named K@@ ev@@ in says : “ E@@ ver since I was a little boy , I have wanted to serve Jehovah full - time some@@ day .
Fin@@ ally , I started pioneering when I was 19 .
I suppor@@ ted myself working part - time for a brother who was a buil@@ der .
I learned to inst@@ all ro@@ of@@ s , w@@ in@@ do@@ ws , and do@@ ors .
Later , I spent two years with a hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e reli@@ ef te@@ am , re@@ building Kingdom H@@ alls and homes for the brothers .
When I heard about the construction needs in South Africa , I app@@ lied and was invited to go .
H@@ ere in Africa , I move from one Kingdom Hall pro@@ ject to another every few weeks .
We live together , study the Bible together , and work together .
I also enjoy preaching with the local brothers each week .
The pl@@ ans I made as a boy have made me happy in ways I did not fore@@ see . ”
Bethel service is a happy way of life because everything you do there is for Jehovah .
After a year and a half , I was invited to Bethel , where I learned to o@@ per@@ ate prin@@ ting pre@@ sses and later to do com@@ pu@@ ter progra@@ m@@ ming .
At Bethel , I enjoy hear@@ ing fir@@ s@@ th@@ and about the progress of the disciple - making activity wor@@ ldwide .
I love serving here because what we do helps people to draw close to Jehovah . ”
You can be sure that Jehovah wants you to “ get a firm hold ” on a happy future .
( Read 1 Timothy 6 : 18 , 19 . )
Then plan to do what is pleas@@ ing to him .
He has stu@@ died human be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or since man was created .
I@@ t@@ ’@@ s something you have to find out for yourself . ”
and “ Do not let them lead you into disa@@ ster ! ”
Jesus said : “ Do not fear those who kill the body and after this are not able to do anything more . ”
Do not be stru@@ ck with ter@@ r@@ or or fear , for Jehovah your God is with you wh@@ e@@ re@@ ver you go . ”
L@@ ist@@ en to Jehovah and trust in him in all that you do .
The second article high@@ li@@ ghts how Jehovah can do the u@@ nex@@ pe@@ cted by accompli@@ shing things we could never imagine .
Like the far@@ mer , we need to wait patiently .
What can we learn from the example of the prophet Mic@@ ah ?
( Read Mic@@ ah 7 : 1 - 3 . )
If we have faith like that of Mic@@ ah , we will be willing to wait for Jehovah .
So we “ endure fully with patience and joy . ”
Abraham had to wait many years before his grand@@ sons E@@ sa@@ u and Jacob were born ( See paragraphs 9 , 10 )
( Read Hebrews 11 : 8 - 12 . )
But just imagine Ab@@ ra@@ ha@@ m@@ ’@@ s joy when he is resurre@@ cted back to a paradise earth .
Although you me@@ ant to har@@ m me , God inten@@ ded it to turn out well and to pre@@ serve many people alive , as he is doing today . ”
( b ) What helped David to wait patiently ?
I will sing to Jehovah , for he has ri@@ ch@@ ly rewar@@ ded me . ”
( Read 2 Peter 3 : 9 . )
What will help us to be willing to wait patiently ?
What lessons do we learn from what happened to the apostle Paul in Philippi ?
( Read Acts 16 : 8 - 10 . )
So@@ on after he arrived in M@@ ace@@ don@@ ia , he ended up in prison !
Why did Jehovah allow this to happen to Paul ?
Bo@@ th he and Silas started “ praying and pra@@ i@@ sing God with song . ”
4 , 5 . ( a ) How could our situation be similar to that of Paul ?
( b ) How did P@@ aul@@ ’@@ s situation change u@@ nex@@ pe@@ c@@ te@@ dly ?
What will we now discuss and re@@ view together ?
( Read 1 Peter 5 : 6 , 7 . )
We need to act in harmony with our prayers .
Sometimes he surpri@@ ses us by doing the u@@ nex@@ pe@@ cted .
Jehovah sent an angel to destroy 18@@ 5@@ ,000 of S@@ en@@ n@@ ach@@ er@@ i@@ b@@ ’@@ s soldiers in one night .
( a ) What lesson do we learn from what happened to Joseph ?
No doubt Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s actions ex@@ ce@@ e@@ ded all of Jose@@ ph@@ ’@@ s expe@@ c@@ ta@@ tions .
Think , too , about Jose@@ ph@@ ’@@ s great - grand@@ mother Sarah .
( Read Isaiah 43 : 10 - 13 . )
We know that Jehovah ca@@ res for us and wants us to succeed .
How can we stri@@ p off and keep off the old personality ?
By 19@@ 39 there were 6@@ ,000 of them in the [ con@@ cent@@ ra@@ tion cam@@ ps ] . ”
And you people have cle@@ an@@ ed the sta@@ di@@ um so n@@ ic@@ ely .

This way of life continued until S@@ ak@@ ur@@ a was 23 years old .
It got so bad that I could not wait for the woman I was living with to leave the house so that I could watch por@@ no@@ gra@@ ph@@ ic vide@@ o@@ s . ”
What helped Steph@@ en to put away anger and ab@@ u@@ sive speech ?
He says : “ Our family life im@@ proved dra@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally .
Today , Steph@@ en serves as a ministerial servant , and his wife has been a regular pioneer for several years .
Bible t@@ ex@@ ts that encouraged me were Isaiah 55 : 7 , which says : ‘ Let the wicked man leave his way , ’ and 1 Corinthians 6 : 11 , which says about those who had ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed sin@@ ful ways : ‘ And yet that is what some of you were . ’
For many years , Jehovah patiently helped me by means of his holy spirit to put on the new personality . ”
We also benefit from Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s Word and his holy spirit when we prepare for and attend congregation meetings .
What will be discu@@ ssed in the next article ?
Some of the n@@ ames in this article have been changed .
See chapter 25 in the book Questions Young People Ask ​ — An@@ s@@ wers That Work , V@@ ol@@ u@@ me 1 .
( Read Colossians 3 : 10 - 14 . )
He stated : “ There is neither Greek nor Jew , circum@@ ci@@ sion nor un@@ circum@@ ci@@ sion , foreign@@ er , S@@ c@@ y@@ thi@@ an , slave , or fre@@ e@@ man . ”
( a ) How do servants of Jehovah need to treat others ?
( See op@@ ening picture . ) ( b ) What have been the results ?
Then he atten@@ ded a meeting of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
You get to experience our wor@@ ldwide bro@@ ther@@ hood and see its mir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ous unity fir@@ s@@ th@@ and . ”
When we showed them scriptu@@ res from their P@@ or@@ tu@@ gu@@ e@@ se Bible , such as Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 or Psalm 37 : 10 , 11 , 29 , they pa@@ id attention and sometimes even shed t@@ ears . ”
We are so than@@ k@@ ful to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Acts 10 : 34 , 35 .
What example did Jesus set in showing mil@@ dness and patience ?
Then he added : “ If you continue showing fav@@ ori@@ ti@@ sm , you are commit@@ ting sin . ”
Why is it important that we clo@@ the ourselves with love ?
Love is also “ patient and kind ” and “ does not get pu@@ f@@ f@@ ed up . ”
Paul said that without love , he was “ nothing . ”
The love is in this respect , not that we have loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son as a pro@@ pi@@ ti@@ at@@ ory sacrifice for our sins . ”
Jesus said : “ No one has love greater than this , that someone should sur@@ ren@@ der his life in behalf of his friends . ”
Let us consider how we can do so .
John wrote : “ L@@ it@@ tle children , we should love , not in word or with the t@@ ong@@ ue , but in deed and truth . ”
But then I asked myself , ‘ How can I imitate Jesus in deal@@ ing with this person ? ’
After refle@@ cting on what Jesus would have done , I decided to let the matter go and not make an issue of it .
Later , I learned that my co@@ wor@@ ker had been cop@@ ing with a serious health problem and was under a lot of stre@@ ss .
I conclu@@ ded that she pro@@ b@@ ably did not really mean what she wrote .
Re@@ fle@@ cting on Jesus ’ example of showing love even when pro@@ vo@@ ked helped me to show similar love to my co@@ wor@@ ker . ”
By lea@@ ving heaven , “ he emp@@ ti@@ ed himself ” in our behalf , even “ to the point of death . ”
PE@@ ACE : “ Pu@@ tting up with one another in love ” al@@ lo@@ ws us to enjoy “ the un@@ iting b@@ ond of peace . ”
Would you not agree that such a peace@@ ful spirit is truly uni@@ qu@@ e in to@@ da@@ y@@ ’@@ s divi@@ ded world ?
Paul wrote : “ Love buil@@ ds up . ”
The following day , they had out@@ gro@@ wn the ven@@ ue . ”
B@@ el@@ ow the picture was the cap@@ tion : “ In@@ va@@ sion of the stre@@ e@@ ts . ”
One congregation wrote , “ The only line that pas@@ ses near this place is a t@@ ele@@ gra@@ ph line . ”

In what ways can parents help their children to develop self - control ?
How can you help your children to develop self - control ?
( Read Ex@@ o@@ d@@ us 34 : 5 - 7 . )
( b ) Why should you be interested in what the Bible says about compassion ?
( a ) Why did Jehovah send angels to So@@ dom ?
( Read Ex@@ o@@ d@@ us 22 : 26 , 27 . )
We read : “ Jehovah the God of their fore@@ fa@@ thers kept warning them by means of his me@@ ss@@ en@@ g@@ ers , warning them again and again , because he felt compassion for his people and for his d@@ well@@ ing place . ”
“ He started to teach them many things . ”
Instead , we need to do all we can now to help people .
One meaning of compassion is “ to suffer together . ”
“ Be courageous and strong and go to work .
How can young ones and their parents show courage ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What important assignment did Solomon receive ?
To succeed , Solomon would need to be courageous and go to work .
What could Solomon learn about courage from his father ?
( Read 1 Chr@@ onic@@ les 28 : 20 . )
How did Jesus ’ courage affect the apostles ?
( Read 2 Timothy 1 : 7 . )
Let us consider two areas of life where we need courage : in our family and in the congregation .
( b ) How can young ones imitate Moses ’ example ?
He will help them provide for the needs of their families .
She wr@@ ites : “ G@@ ro@@ wing up , I was really sh@@ y .
I could b@@ are@@ ly talk to people at the Kingdom Hall , much less kno@@ ck on the do@@ ors of complete strangers . ”
With the help of her parents and others in the congregation , this young Christian ach@@ i@@ ev@@ ed her goal of becoming a regular pioneer .
How can Psalm 37 : 25 and Hebrews 13 : 5 help parents ?
( Read Psalm 37 : 25 ; Hebrews 13 : 5 . )
A brother who has two children wrote : “ Many parents exp@@ end much effort and re@@ sour@@ ces helping their children reach goals in such areas as sp@@ or@@ ts , re@@ creation , and education .
It makes so much more sense to exp@@ end effort and re@@ sour@@ ces in helping our children reach goals that will help them to maintain a good standing with Jehovah .
It has been a great source of satisfac@@ tion not only to see our children reach spiritual goals but to share the j@@ our@@ ney with them . ”
Give examples of courage in the Christian congregation .
( Read Titus 2 : 3 - 5 . )
( a ) How can baptized brothers be courageous ?
( Read Philippians 2 : 13 ; 4 : 13 . )
We ur@@ ge all baptized brothers to be courageous and work hard for the congregation !
Therefore , “ be courageous . . . and go to work . ”
1 , 2 . ( a ) What would life be like without the Bible ?
The apostle Peter qu@@ o@@ ted Isaiah 40 : 8 .
( Read 1 Peter 1 : 24 , 25 . )
( a ) How do languages change over time ?
( Read Revelation 14 : 6 , foo@@ t@@ note . )
Later prin@@ tings also used the word “ L@@ OR@@ D ” in cap@@ ital le@@ tters in some ver@@ ses in the Christian Greek Scriptures .
Why are we grateful for the New World T@@ ran@@ slation ?
( b ) What is the Greek Sep@@ tu@@ ag@@ int ?
( Read Psalm 119 : 16@@ 2 - 16@@ 5 . )
( Read Isaiah 48 : 17 , 18 . )
What will we consider in the following article ?
See the article “ Do You Ne@@ ed to L@@ earn Hebrew and Greek ? ”

“ The word of God is alive and ex@@ er@@ ts power . ” ​ — HE@@ B .
( Read 1 Corinthians 6 : 9 - 11 . )
( Read Ephesians 5 : 15 , 16 . )
He read 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 , which says : “ The Father of ten@@ der mer@@ ci@@ es and the God of all comfort . . . com@@ forts us in all our trials . ”
What responsibility do brothers who teach from the pl@@ at@@ form have ?
Are we not grateful to Jehovah for his written Word , the Bible ?
See the box “ A Tur@@ ning Po@@ int . ”
Take time to explain , illu@@ strate , and apply ver@@ ses that you read
“ A tur@@ ning point came about 15 years after I was baptized .
During a talk at the Kingdom Hall . . . , the spea@@ ker refer@@ red to James 1 : 23 , 24 .
Those ver@@ ses lik@@ en Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s Word to a mir@@ r@@ or in which we can see ourselves the way Jehovah sees us .
I began to wonder if what I saw in myself was different from what Jehovah saw .
At first , I re@@ sist@@ ed this new i@@ dea .
I still felt that loving me was too much to expect of Jehovah .
“ A few days later , I read a s@@ crip@@ ture that changed my life .
The verse was Isaiah 1 : 18 , where Jehovah is qu@@ o@@ ted as saying : ‘ Co@@ me , now , you people , and let us set matters stra@@ ight between us . . . .
Though the sins of you people should prove to be as s@@ car@@ let , they will be made white just like s@@ now . ’
I felt as if Jehovah were speaking to me , saying : ‘ Co@@ me on , V@@ ic@@ k@@ y , le@@ t@@ ’@@ s set matters stra@@ ight between us .
I know you , I know your sins , I know your heart ​ — and I love you . ’
“ I was un@@ able to sleep that night .
I still doub@@ ted that Jehovah could love me , but I began thinking about Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice .
All of a su@@ d@@ den , it da@@ w@@ ned on me that Jehovah had been patient with me for so long , showing me that he loved me in so many ways .
Yet , I was , in effect , saying to him : ‘ Your love is not great enough to reach me .
Your S@@ on@@ ’@@ s sacrifice is not enough to cover me . ’
It was as if I had been thro@@ wing the ransom back at Jehovah .
But now , at last , by med@@ itating on this gift of the ransom , I began to feel loved by Jehovah . ”
These articles discuss Ze@@ chari@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s si@@ x@@ th , se@@ ven@@ th , and e@@ igh@@ th vi@@ sions .
First , let me tell you about my back@@ ground .
I WA@@ S born in 19@@ 23 in He@@ m@@ s@@ worth , a town in Y@@ or@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , England .
The following year , I was appointed as a special pioneer , along with Mary H@@ en@@ sh@@ all .
We were sent to un@@ assigned territory in the coun@@ ty of Ch@@ e@@ sh@@ ire .
It is a great joy to know that there are now many Witnesses in that area .
My brother and his wife , Lo@@ t@@ ti@@ e , were already serving as special pioneers in N@@ or@@ thern Ireland , and in 195@@ 2 the four of us atten@@ ded a dist@@ ri@@ ct convention in B@@ el@@ fast .
That night the four of us sle@@ pt in the car .
A@@ ma@@ z@@ ingly , we had no problem par@@ king the tra@@ il@@ er on the property of friend@@ ly far@@ m@@ ers .
We really enjoyed our assignment in the circuit work .
The first inter@@ national convention in Ireland was held in D@@ u@@ bl@@ in in 196@@ 5 .
A to@@ tal of 3@@ ,@@ 9@@ 48 atten@@ ded , and 65 got baptized .

In the last few years , I have felt heart@@ break , de@@ pre@@ ssion , and gri@@ ef .
In the past , Arthur had always been there for me .
But when you go through these kin@@ ds of situations , you draw closer to Jehovah .

How did Peter help a Christian sister who had died ?
One time , the apostle Paul was at a meeting in an u@@ pper room in T@@ ro@@ as , in what is now nor@@ th@@ we@@ st Turkey .
A young man named Eu@@ ty@@ ch@@ us was list@@ ening , se@@ ated at a w@@ in@@ d@@ ow .
Also , Jehovah said that the blessing would come “ through Isaac . ”

Paul wrote that “ Christ has been raised from the dead , the first@@ fru@@ its of those who have f@@ all@@ en as@@ le@@ ep in death . ”
What will happen to some anointed ones during Chri@@ st@@ ’@@ s pres@@ ence ?
For if we have faith that Jesus died and ro@@ se again , so too God will bring with him those who have f@@ all@@ en as@@ le@@ ep in death . . .
We the living who survive to the pres@@ ence of the Lord will in no way pre@@ ce@@ de those who have f@@ all@@ en as@@ le@@ ep in death ; because the Lord himself will de@@ sc@@ end from heaven with a comman@@ ding call , . . . and those who are dead in uni@@ on with Christ will ri@@ se first .

If you come back , I will break your le@@ g@@ s . ”
I was born on July 29 , 19@@ 29 , and gre@@ w up in a village in the pro@@ v@@ ince of B@@ ul@@ ac@@ an in the Philippines .
I enjoyed reading the Bible , especially the four Go@@ sp@@ els .
Do@@ ing so made me want to follow Jesus ’ example . ​ — John 10 : 27 .
About that time , my parents asked me to come back home .
One older Witness came to our house and explained what the Bible says about “ the last days . ”
He invited us to attend a Bible study in a ne@@ ar@@ by village .
We spent most of that night discu@@ ssing the Bible .
I rep@@ lied , “ Yes , I do . ”
I knew that I wanted to “ slave for the Ma@@ ster , Christ . ”
We went to a ne@@ ar@@ by ri@@ ver , and two of us got baptized on Fe@@ b@@ ru@@ ary 15 , 194@@ 6 .
The C@@ ru@@ z family invited me to live with them in An@@ g@@ at .
He spoke in English , and af@@ ter@@ ward I gave a su@@ m@@ mar@@ y of his talk in T@@ ag@@ al@@ o@@ g .
In the early morning , I helped in the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en .
After I gradu@@ ated , I was temp@@ or@@ ar@@ ily assigned as a special pioneer in the B@@ ron@@ x in New York City .
We spent the first week after our we@@ d@@ ding vis@@ iting a congregation on R@@ ap@@ u R@@ ap@@ u Is@@ land .
We were even able to buy the property from the man who had said that “ Ch@@ in@@ e@@ se do not sell . ”
The new@@ ly fer@@ ti@@ li@@ zed e@@ g@@ g might grow in a F@@ al@@ lo@@ pi@@ an tu@@ be ( an e@@ c@@ topic pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cy ) or might travel into the wo@@ m@@ b .
That would end the pre@@ gn@@ an@@ cy at an early st@@ age .
A guide from En@@ gl@@ and@@ ’@@ s Na@@ tional He@@ al@@ th Ser@@ vice rep@@ or@@ ts : “ I@@ UD@@ s with more co@@ pper are more than 9@@ 9 % effective .

Does the Bible@@ ’@@ s ex@@ plan@@ ation make sense to them ?
What should be an important part of your teaching ?
Steph@@ ani@@ e , the mother of three daugh@@ ters , says : “ E@@ ver since my children were very young , I have had to ask myself , ‘ Do I talk to my children about why I am convinced of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s ex@@ ist@@ ence , his love , and the righ@@ t@@ ness of his ways ?
Can my children clearly see that I really love Jehovah ? ’
I can@@ ’@@ t expect my children to be per@@ su@@ a@@ ded un@@ less I am . ”
The Bible says that “ foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness is b@@ ound up in the heart of a child . ”
That kind of wisdom is necessary for salvation .

What does it mean to work out your own salvation “ with fear and tre@@ mb@@ ling ” ?
What to@@ ol@@ s have helped you in your personal study ?
Jesus said : “ No man can come to me un@@ less the Father , who sent me , dra@@ ws him . ”
So I@@ ’@@ ll men@@ tion something in pas@@ sing , such as , ‘ I was teaching the Bible the other day , and . . . ’
Then I continue with the point of my story .
Although the im@@ medi@@ ate point is not in it@@ self about the Bible , often others are cu@@ ri@@ ous about what I do when teaching the Bible .
The more I use this approach , the easi@@ er it ge@@ ts .
And af@@ ter@@ ward , I always feel great ! ”
We are the only Witnesses they are ex@@ posed to .
So the way we act can determine how they will respond .
What if we are sh@@ y or ti@@ mi@@ d or have a hard time speaking up about our faith , or what if we c@@ r@@ ing@@ e when we do speak up ?
Then they may look at us as if we a@@ ren@@ ’@@ t prou@@ d of who we are .
They may even respond un@@ kin@@ dly because of our lack of confidence .
However , if we talk with ea@@ se and as@@ surance about what we believe , making it a normal part of conversa@@ tion , it@@ ’@@ s more likely that they will respect us . ”
Jesus said : “ If anyone wants to come after me , let him diso@@ wn himself and pi@@ ck up his t@@ or@@ ture st@@ ake and keep following me . ”

What lesson can we learn from Isaiah 40 : 26 ?
No one has been able to coun@@ t all the star@@ s in the uni@@ verse .
How can we be sure that Jehovah is able to strengthen us ?
And he added : “ You will find re@@ fre@@ sh@@ ment for y@@ ourselves .

For it is to us God has reve@@ aled them through his spirit . ”
Jesus said : “ These things I have spo@@ ken to you , so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be made full . ”
( 3 ) How will our effort to have “ the mind of Christ ” help us to be spiritual people ?
( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 14 - 16 . )
What does the Bible say about spiritually - minded people ?
What can we learn from the example of Jacob ?
What can we learn from the example of Mary ?
( Read Luke 1 : 46 - 55 . )
( Read Isaiah 6@@ 3 : 9 ; Mark 6 : 34 . )
Rachel , a sister in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il , says : “ I loved to follow the wor@@ ld@@ ’@@ s f@@ as@@ hi@@ ons .
As a result , I did not dress very mo@@ dest@@ ly .
But learning the truth moved me to make the needed effort to be a spiritual person .
Ma@@ king changes was not easy , but I became happ@@ i@@ er and found real purpose in life . ”
So being like Jesus makes us more like Jehovah .
They said : “ We are wit@@ nesses of all the things he did . ”
How will having the mind of Christ affect your daily life ?
He says : “ I never did anything wrong , but I was just going through the mo@@ tions .

I thought to myself , ‘ If I am going to be my wi@@ fe@@ ’@@ s spiritual head , I have to do something . ’ ”
He says : “ I stu@@ died the Bible and stu@@ died and stu@@ died some more , and the pi@@ e@@ ces started to fit together .
I got understanding and , most important , develop@@ ed a close relationship with Jehovah . ”
( 3 ) How can strong spirituality help us in our daily life ?
( b ) What is our goal when we study and meditate ?
( b ) What Bible example can we imitate ?
12 , 13 . ( a ) What will help us to apply Romans 15 : 5 ?

5 , 6 . ( a ) The Bible@@ ’@@ s des@@ crip@@ tion of Timothy lead@@ s us to what conclu@@ sion about his baptism ?
( Read Colossians 1 : 9 , 10 . )
He told Jehovah that he was so happy about his little gir@@ l@@ ’@@ s decision to dedi@@ c@@ ate her life to H@@ im . ”
( Read 1 Peter 3 : 20 , 21 . )
Why do we not pressure anyone to get baptized ?
What questions will we consider in the next article ?
If you are a parent , you may have asked yourself : ‘ Is my child really ready to get baptized ?
The first question is , “ On the basis of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ , have you rep@@ en@@ ted of your sins and dedicated yourself to Jehovah to do his will ? ”
How can we be hospit@@ able at our Christian meetings ?
( Read 3 John 5 - 8 . )
He wr@@ ites : “ I he@@ sit@@ ated initi@@ ally because we were new@@ ly married and living in a small house .
But having students stay with us was truly a joy@@ ous experience .
As new@@ ly@@ we@@ ds , we were able to see how happy a couple can be when they serve Jehovah and pursue spiritual goals together . ”
Why may those who are new to your congregation need hospitality ?
( Read Luke 10 : 41 , 42 . )
One evening my wife was parti@@ cul@@ arly ho@@ me@@ sick , and my efforts to help were not working .
Then , about 7 : 30 p@@ .@@ m . , we heard a kno@@ ck on the door .
There stood a Bible student who brought us three or@@ ang@@ es .
She had come to welcome the new mission@@ aries .
We invited her in and gave her a gl@@ as@@ s of water .
If you feel anx@@ ious about having gu@@ ests , you are not alone .
An elder in Britain ad@@ m@@ its : “ There can be a measure of n@@ er@@ v@@ ousness in pre@@ par@@ ing for gu@@ ests .
But as with anything in rela@@ tion to serving Jehovah , the benefits and satisfac@@ tion that result far ou@@ tw@@ e@@ igh any anxiety .
I have enjoyed simply sit@@ ting down with gu@@ ests over co@@ ffe@@ e and tal@@ king . ”
Another elder wr@@ ites : “ Ha@@ ving friends from the congregation to my home helps me to understand them better and gives me time to get to know them , especially how they came into the truth . ”
The wife of one of the instru@@ ct@@ ors really put me at ea@@ se .
She said that when she and her husband are serving in the traveling work , their best weeks are those spent sta@@ ying with a spiritual person who may not have much materi@@ ally but who has the same focus as they have ​ — serving Jehovah and keeping life simple .
This re@@ minded me of what my mu@@ m used to say to us as children : ‘ Better a dis@@ h of ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les where the@@ re@@ ’@@ s love . ’ ”
( Read Proverbs 25 : 21 , 22 . )
Ho@@ sts u@@ su@@ ally prepare well for their gu@@ ests ( See paragraph 20 )

The elder re@@ called : “ G@@ raham had a problem with pride .
He was cri@@ tical of the elders who had been involved in his disfellow@@ shipp@@ ing .
So for the next few stu@@ dies , we discu@@ ssed scriptu@@ res on pride and its effe@@ cts .
G@@ raham began to see himself clearly in the mir@@ r@@ or of Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s Word , and he did not like what he saw !
After ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging that he had been bl@@ in@@ ded by a ‘ ra@@ fter ’ of pride and that his cri@@ tical attitude was his problem , he began to change quickly for the better .
He started to attend Christian meetings regularly , to study Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s Word earne@@ stly , and to make daily prayer a ha@@ b@@ it .
‘ I@@ ’@@ ve known the truth for years , ’ he said , ‘ and I@@ ’@@ ve even served as a pioneer .
The apostle Peter wrote : “ She@@ pher@@ d the flo@@ ck of God under your care , serving as overseers , not under com@@ pu@@ l@@ sion , but will@@ ingly before God ; not for love of di@@ sh@@ one@@ st gain , but ea@@ g@@ er@@ ly ; not l@@ or@@ ding it over those who are Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s inher@@ it@@ ance , but becoming examples to the flo@@ ck . ”

( b ) How did one family benefit from the parents ’ obedi@@ ence to Jehovah ?
Some years later , the daughter was re@@ in@@ stated .
( b ) How can we make the elders ’ work more pleas@@ ant for them ?
They did not ber@@ ate me or cri@@ tici@@ ze me , but they encouraged me and strengthened me .
After every congregation meeting , no matter how bus@@ y they were , at lea@@ st one of them would ask how I was .
Because of my past , I found it difficult to feel worthy of Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s love .
Ti@@ me and time again , however , Jehovah has used the congregation and the elders to con@@ firm his love for me .
I pray that I will never let him go . ”
If you turn to doing good , will you not be re@@ sto@@ red to favor ?
But if you do not turn to doing good , sin is c@@ rou@@ ch@@ ing at the door , and its c@@ ra@@ ving is to do@@ min@@ ate you ; but will you get the ma@@ st@@ er@@ y over it ? ”
So let us “ listen to discipline and become wise . ”
People around the world are de@@ man@@ ding more freedom .

To enjoy the ‘ good , ’ hu@@ mankind must trust God and obey him .
If they diso@@ b@@ ey , they will be left to decide for themselves what is good . . . and what is not good . ”
Like that p@@ il@@ ot , Adam and Eve wanted to do things their own way .
He said : “ If you remain in my word , you are really my disciples , and you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free . ”
Why can the freedom that Jesus promised make us “ truly free ” ?
( Read Romans 7 : 21 - 25 . )
( Read Romans 8 : 1 , 2 , 20 , 21 . )
( c ) What questions do we need to answer ?

She also sha@@ red with me her own experience with the kind of test I was going through , and I felt less alone . ”
King Solomon wrote : “ A word spo@@ ken at the right time ​ — how good it is !
A che@@ erful gl@@ ance makes the heart rejoice ; a good rep@@ ort in@@ vi@@ g@@ or@@ ates the b@@ ones . ”
For you have made me rejoice , O Jehovah , because of your dee@@ ds ; because of the works of your hands I shout joy@@ fully . ”
The apostle Paul promised : “ God is not un@@ righteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name . ”
You are never too young to set goals .
Proverbs 21 : 5 says : “ The pl@@ ans of the di@@ li@@ gent su@@ rely lead to succe@@ ss . ”
The earlier you make pl@@ ans by setting good goals , the so@@ on@@ er you will have succe@@ ss .
With a uni@@ vers@@ ity de@@ gree in law , I could have ear@@ ned a lot of money , but I would have had little chance of fin@@ ding part - time work . ”
17 , 18 . ( a ) What does Jehovah want for young people today ?
I was born in a one - room lo@@ g c@@ ab@@ in in a very small town called Li@@ ber@@ ty , In@@ di@@ ana , U.S@@ .@@ A .
Later , my mother gave bir@@ th to my two younger brothers and my younger sister .
D@@ U@@ R@@ ING my school years , not much changed .
The town of Li@@ ber@@ ty was sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by small far@@ ms , and the basic cro@@ p was cor@@ n .
She took us to the B@@ apti@@ st church every S@@ un@@ day .
They wanted me to make the military my care@@ er .
This time , however , they invited me to come to a Congregation Book Stu@@ dy , a small meeting for Bible study and dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion that was held in their home .
I told them I would think about it .
I cou@@ ld@@ n@@ ’@@ t believe how much they knew about the Bible !
Y@@ ears before , when I asked my mother about Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , she simply said , “ O@@ h , they worship some old man named Jehovah . ”
But I now felt that my eyes were being op@@ ened !
I started pioneering the next year , in 195@@ 8 .
G@@ l@@ ori@@ a was a je@@ w@@ el then , and she is a je@@ w@@ el today .
G@@ l@@ ori@@ a and I got married in Fe@@ b@@ ru@@ ary of 195@@ 9 .
A de@@ ar brother , Sim@@ on K@@ ra@@ ker , inter@@ vie@@ wed us .
He told us that Bethel was not accep@@ ting married cou@@ ples at that time .
Most of our jo@@ bs pa@@ id three dol@@ lar@@ s a day .
Each week , G@@ l@@ ori@@ a did ir@@ on@@ ing for one family .
I remember one time when we sto@@ pped at a g@@ as st@@ ation .
On the other hand , we had wonderful times with the brothers , and we loved our ministry !
Me@@ an@@ while , I started a study with the cou@@ ple@@ ’@@ s daughter and her husband .
M@@ other and daughter both decided to serve Jehovah and got baptized .
We had de@@ ar friends in the white congregation .
The K@@ u K@@ lu@@ x K@@ l@@ an ( K@@ K@@ K ) , an organization that promo@@ tes rac@@ is@@ m and violence , was very ac@@ tive then .
In 196@@ 2 , I was invited to attend the Kingdom Minist@@ ry School at South L@@ ans@@ ing , New York .
However , a t@@ ele@@ phone comp@@ any in P@@ ine B@@ lu@@ f@@ f had inter@@ vie@@ wed me for a jo@@ b .
If they hi@@ red me , I would be the first bl@@ ack man to work for that comp@@ any .
I had no money to travel to New York .
She said , “ Go to school and learn as much as you can , and come back and teach us ! ”
H@@ ere is how G@@ l@@ ori@@ a re@@ members our time in P@@ ine B@@ lu@@ f@@ f : “ I f@@ ell in love with the territory !
So we would go in the house - to - house work in the morning and then conduct Bible stu@@ dies the rest of the day , sometimes until 11 o@@ ’@@ clo@@ ck at night .
While we were pioneering in P@@ ine B@@ lu@@ f@@ f , we app@@ lied to become special pioneers .
Brother Le@@ on W@@ ea@@ ver , now the co@@ ord@@ in@@ ator of the United States B@@ ranch Com@@ mit@@ te@@ e , was appointed to serve as a circuit overseer at the same time .
I was n@@ er@@ v@@ ous about becoming a circuit overseer .
After I was appointed , Brother Tho@@ mp@@ son was the first dist@@ ri@@ ct overseer I served with .
In those days , a circuit overseer received little training .
I remember saying to G@@ l@@ ori@@ a , “ Does he really have to leave now ? ”
One time , the K@@ K@@ K held a mar@@ ch in a town we were vis@@ iting in T@@ en@@ ne@@ s@@ see .
The following month , we began our Bethel service .
G@@ l@@ ori@@ a was a je@@ w@@ el when I married her , and she still is
Then in 199@@ 9 , I was appointed to be a member of the Governing Body .
Isaiah 32 : 17 says : “ The result of true righteousness will be peace , and the fruitage of true righteousness will be lasting tran@@ qu@@ ill@@ ity and se@@ cur@@ ity . ”
Second , we must pray for Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s holy spirit .
If the house is de@@ serving , let the peace you wish it come upon it ; but if it is not de@@ serving , let the peace from you return upon you . ”
So I gree@@ ted her in her own t@@ ong@@ ue .
T@@ a@@ ken by surprise , she asked me , ‘ What is the reason for your visit ? ’
I po@@ lit@@ ely told her that I wi@@ shed to see the High Com@@ mission@@ er .
She t@@ ele@@ ph@@ on@@ ed the of@@ ficial , who came out to meet me and gree@@ ted me in the local language .
After that , he care@@ fully list@@ ened to me as I explained to him the peace@@ ful activities of the Witnesses . ”
