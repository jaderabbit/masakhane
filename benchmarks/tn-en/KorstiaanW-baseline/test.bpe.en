This magazine has been publ@@ ished continu@@ ously since 18@@ 7@@ 9 and is non@@ polit@@ ical .
It ad@@ he@@ res to the Bible as its authority .
Be@@ be had been very close to her father .
The re@@ mar@@ k came from a well - meaning family friend , but Be@@ be found it more c@@ ut@@ ting than com@@ for@@ ting .
“ His death wa@@ s@@ n@@ ’@@ t for the best , ” she kept re@@ pe@@ ating to her@@ self .
It was clear that when Be@@ be rec@@ oun@@ ted the in@@ ci@@ dent in a book years later , she was still gri@@ ev@@ ing .
As Be@@ be came to see , it can take a long time for someone to over@@ come gri@@ ef , especially when the be@@ rea@@ ved person was very close to the dec@@ e@@ a@@ sed .
In the Bible , death is ap@@ tly descri@@ bed as “ the last enem@@ y . ”
It b@@ re@@ ak@@ s into our lives with ir@@ re@@ sis@@ ti@@ ble for@@ ce , often when we are comp@@ let@@ ely un@@ pre@@ pa@@ red , and it ro@@ bs us of those we hold de@@ ar .
N@@ one of us are im@@ mu@@ ne to its ra@@ v@@ ages .
So it is not sur@@ pris@@ ing if we feel at a lo@@ ss when it comes to cop@@ ing with death and its af@@ ter@@ mat@@ h .
Per@@ haps you have won@@ dered : ‘ How long does it take to get over gri@@ ef ?
How can I comfort others who have been be@@ rea@@ ved ?
Is there any hope for our loved ones who have died ? ’
Ha@@ ve you ever had a bri@@ ef bo@@ ut with ill@@ ness ?
As an example , consider how the pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch Abraham re@@ ac@@ ted when his wife died .
The Bible says that “ Abraham began to mo@@ ur@@ n and to we@@ ep over S@@ ar@@ ah . ”
The expre@@ ssion “ began to ” sugg@@ ests that it took some time for him to c@@ ope with his lo@@ ss .
He gri@@ ev@@ ed for “ many days , ” and his family members were un@@ able to comfort him .
S@@ ever@@ al years later , the death of Joseph still we@@ igh@@ ed heav@@ ily on his mind . ​ — Genesis 23 : 2 ; 37 : 34 , 35 ; 42 : 36 ; 45 : 28 .
“ My husband , R@@ ob@@ er@@ t , died on Ju@@ ly 9 , 200@@ 8 .
Si@@ x years later the pain in my heart is still there .
I don@@ ’@@ t think I will ever get over my lo@@ ss of Ro@@ b . ” ​ — G@@ a@@ il , ag@@ ed 60 .
“ Although I have been without my de@@ ar wife for more than 18 years , I still mis@@ s her and gri@@ eve over my lo@@ ss .
Wh@@ en@@ ever I see something in n@@ ature that is at@@ tra@@ ctive , my though@@ ts go to her , and I cannot help wonder@@ ing how she would have enjo@@ yed see@@ ing what I am see@@ ing . ” ​ — E@@ ti@@ en@@ ne , ag@@ ed 8@@ 4 .
C@@ learly , such pa@@ in@@ ful and long - lasting feelings are only natural .
E@@ ach person gri@@ ev@@ es in his or her own way , and it would be un@@ wise to jud@@ ge the way another person respon@@ ds to t@@ rag@@ e@@ dy .
At the same time , we may need to hold off from con@@ de@@ m@@ ning ourselves if our re@@ action to lo@@ ss seem@@ s exc@@ es@@ sive .
As we no@@ te in the “ I@@ mit@@ ate Their Fa@@ ith ” article in this issue , Isa@@ a@@ c was still gri@@ ev@@ ing over the lo@@ ss of his mother , S@@ ar@@ ah , three years after her death . ​ — Genesis 24 : 6@@ 7 .
For inst@@ ance , you may find that some will ad@@ vi@@ se you not to c@@ ry or show your feelings in any way .
O@@ thers may pu@@ sh you to do the op@@ pos@@ ite and ex@@ pose all your feelings .
The Bible presen@@ ts a more bal@@ an@@ ced view , one that is sup@@ por@@ ted by moder@@ n re@@ search .
In some cul@@ tu@@ res it is consi@@ dered un@@ man@@ ly for a ma@@ le to c@@ ry .
But is there a real need to feel as@@ ha@@ med about she@@ d@@ ding te@@ ars , even in public ?
M@@ en@@ tal - health ex@@ per@@ ts ac@@ knowledge that te@@ ar@@ ful@@ ness is a nor@@ mal part of gri@@ ev@@ ing .
And gri@@ ev@@ ing may , in time , help you to move on des@@ pite the en@@ or@@ m@@ ity of your lo@@ ss .
S@@ up@@ pres@@ sing gri@@ ef , however , may do more har@@ m than good .
The Bible len@@ ds no support to the no@@ tion that it is wrong or un@@ man@@ ly to sh@@ ed te@@ ars of gri@@ ef .
At the death of his de@@ ar friend La@@ z@@ ar@@ us , Jesus op@@ en@@ ly we@@ p@@ t , even though he had the power to bring the dead back to life ! ​ — John 11 : 33 - 35 .
B@@ ou@@ ts of anger are often part of gri@@ ev@@ ing , especially in ca@@ ses of su@@ d@@ den , u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted death .
There are many reas@@ ons why a be@@ rea@@ ved person may feel ang@@ ry , such as when though@@ tl@@ ess and un@@ foun@@ ded comm@@ ents are made by a respe@@ cted person .
“ I was only 14 years old when my father died , ” explains a S@@ ou@@ th Afri@@ can man named M@@ i@@ ke .
“ At the fun@@ er@@ al , the A@@ ng@@ li@@ can minis@@ ter said that God needs good people and takes them early .
* This ang@@ ere@@ d me because we des@@ per@@ ately needed our father .
E@@ speci@@ ally in the case of u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted death , the be@@ rea@@ ved person may re@@ pe@@ at@@ e@@ dly think , ‘ It might not have happen@@ ed if only I had done this or that . ’
If you are being pla@@ gu@@ ed by such feelings of gu@@ il@@ t and anger , it is important not to bo@@ t@@ tle up these emo@@ tions .
Rather , speak to a friend who will lis@@ ten and reas@@ sure you that such ir@@ r@@ ational feelings are common to many be@@ rea@@ ved ones .
The Bible re@@ min@@ ds us : “ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of dist@@ re@@ ss . ” ​ — Proverbs 17 : 17 .
The best F@@ ri@@ end a be@@ rea@@ ved person can have is our Creator , Jehovah God .
P@@ our out your heart to him in prayer because “ he ca@@ res for you . ”
Mo@@ re@@ over , he promi@@ ses that all who do so will have their though@@ ts and feelings so@@ o@@ th@@ ed by “ the peace of God that sur@@ pas@@ ses all understanding . ”
Al@@ so , allow God to help you he@@ al by means of his con@@ sol@@ ing Word , the Bible .
Ha@@ ving such though@@ ts to pon@@ der over may be especially help@@ ful at night when you are alone and find it hard to s@@ le@@ ep . ​ — Isaiah 5@@ 7 : 15 .
Re@@ cen@@ tly , a 40 - year - old man , whom we will call J@@ ack , lost his b@@ elo@@ ved wife to can@@ c@@ er .
“ When I pray to Jehovah , ” he explains , “ I never feel alone .
I often wake up during the night and cannot get back to s@@ le@@ ep .
After reading and medi@@ t@@ ating on com@@ for@@ ting though@@ ts from the Scriptures and then p@@ our@@ ing out the feelings of my heart in prayer , I sense a cal@@ m@@ ness and a trans@@ cen@@ ding peace come over me , p@@ ut@@ ting my mind and heart at rest and en@@ ab@@ ling me to s@@ le@@ ep . ”
A young woman named V@@ an@@ es@@ sa lost her mother to ill@@ ness .
She too has experi@@ enced the power of prayer .
“ In my most difficult times , ” she says , “ I would just call on Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s name and b@@ rea@@ k down in te@@ ars .
Jehovah listen@@ ed to my pray@@ ers and always gave me the strength I needed . ”
Some be@@ re@@ av@@ ement coun@@ sel@@ ors ad@@ vi@@ se those who are stru@@ gg@@ ling with gri@@ ef to get involved in help@@ ing others or to vol@@ un@@ te@@ er their time in some comm@@ unity service .
Do@@ ing so can bring joy and may e@@ ase a person@@ ’@@ s gri@@ ef .
Many be@@ rea@@ ved Christians have found that working to help others has brought them great comfort . ​ — 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 .
God feel@@ s for you in your pain . ​ — Psalm 5@@ 5 : 22 ; 1 Peter 5 : 7 .
God pati@@ ently listen@@ s to the pray@@ ers of his servants . ​ — Psalm 8@@ 6 : 5 ; 1 Th@@ es@@ sal@@ on@@ ians 5 : 17 .
God mis@@ ses people who have died . ​ — Job 14 : 13 - 15 .
God promi@@ ses to resur@@ re@@ ct the dead . ​ — Isaiah 26 : 19 ; John 5 : 28 , 29 .
Ha@@ ve you ever felt help@@ less when someone near to you was gri@@ ev@@ ing over the lo@@ ss of a loved one ?
So@@ me@@ times we may feel un@@ sure of what to say or do ​ — so we w@@ ind up saying and doing nothing .
But there are practic@@ al , help@@ ful things that we can do .
O@@ f@@ ten , all that is needed is your presen@@ ce along with a simp@@ le expre@@ ssion , such as “ I am so s@@ or@@ ry . ”
In many cul@@ tu@@ res , giving the person a hu@@ g or a gen@@ tle s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze of the ar@@ m is an effe@@ ctive way to show you care .
If the be@@ rea@@ ved one wan@@ ts to talk , lis@@ ten sy@@ mp@@ a@@ the@@ tic@@ ally .
B@@ est of all , do something for the be@@ rea@@ ved family , perhaps per@@ form@@ ing a cho@@ re the gri@@ ev@@ ing one has not been able to care for , such as co@@ ok@@ ing a me@@ al , car@@ ing for the children , or help@@ ing with fun@@ er@@ al arrang@@ em@@ ents if that is desi@@ red .
Such ac@@ tions may speak l@@ ou@@ der than the most elo@@ qu@@ ent words .
In time , you may be moved to talk about the dec@@ e@@ a@@ sed , perhaps fo@@ cu@@ sing on some good qualities or happy experi@@ ences .
Such con@@ vers@@ ation may even bring a sm@@ ile to the be@@ rea@@ ved person@@ ’@@ s face .
For example , P@@ am ​ — who lost her husband , I@@ an , si@@ x years ago — ​ says : “ People some@@ times tell me good things that I@@ an did that I never knew about , and that makes my heart feel good . ”
Re@@ sear@@ ch@@ ers re@@ port that many be@@ rea@@ ved people receive a lo@@ t of in@@ iti@@ al help but that their needs are soon for@@ go@@ t@@ ten as friends get bu@@ s@@ y again with their own lives .
The@@ refore , make a point of cont@@ ac@@ ting a be@@ rea@@ ved friend on a regu@@ lar bas@@ is after the lo@@ ss .
* Many gri@@ ev@@ ing ones de@@ ep@@ ly appreci@@ ate this opport@@ unity to reli@@ eve themselves of p@@ r@@ ol@@ ong@@ ed feelings of gri@@ ef .
Consider the example of Ka@@ or@@ i , a young Jap@@ ane@@ se woman who was dev@@ ast@@ ated by the lo@@ ss of her mother follow@@ ed by the lo@@ ss of her older sister 15 months later .
Th@@ an@@ k@@ fully , she received on@@ going support from loy@@ al friends .
One named R@@ its@@ u@@ ko is much older than Ka@@ or@@ i and of@@ fered to be her close friend .
“ To be hon@@ est , ” says Ka@@ or@@ i , “ I wa@@ s@@ n@@ ’@@ t happy about that .
I di@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t want anyone to take the place of my mother , and I di@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t think that anyone could .
However , because of the way M@@ ama R@@ its@@ u@@ ko tre@@ ated me , I came to feel close to her .
E@@ very we@@ ek , we went out in the ev@@ ang@@ eli@@ z@@ ing work together and went to Christian meetings together .
She inv@@ ited me to have te@@ a with her , brought me me@@ als , and wrote me let@@ ters and car@@ ds many times .
M@@ ama R@@ its@@ u@@ ko@@ ’@@ s pos@@ itive attitude had a good influ@@ ence on me . ”
T@@ wel@@ ve years have pas@@ sed since Ka@@ or@@ i@@ ’@@ s mother died , and today she and her husband are full - time ev@@ ang@@ eli@@ z@@ ers .
“ M@@ ama R@@ its@@ u@@ ko , ” Ka@@ or@@ i says , “ continu@@ es to show her concer@@ n .
When I go back home , I always vis@@ it her and enjoy her up@@ building associ@@ ation . ”
Ano@@ ther example of someone who benef@@ ited from on@@ going support is Pol@@ i , one of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses in C@@ yp@@ r@@ us .
Pol@@ i had a kind husband , So@@ z@@ o@@ s , who set a good example as a Christian she@@ pher@@ d by often inv@@ iting or@@ ph@@ ans and wi@@ do@@ ws to their home for associ@@ ation and a me@@ al .
S@@ ad@@ ly , at the age of 5@@ 3 , So@@ z@@ o@@ s died of a bra@@ in tu@@ mo@@ r .
There , they began associ@@ ating with a congregation of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
“ The friends in my new congregation , ” rec@@ al@@ ls Pol@@ i , “ did not know anything about our past and our difficult circumstances .
But that did not sto@@ p them from appro@@ aching us and em@@ bra@@ c@@ ing us with their kind words and practic@@ al help .
How preci@@ ous that help was , especially at that time , when my son needed his father most !
Those taking the lead in the congregation showed a great de@@ al of personal interest in Daniel .
One in particu@@ lar made sure to inclu@@ de Daniel when enjo@@ ying associ@@ ation with friends or when going out to pla@@ y b@@ all . ”
Bo@@ th mother and son are doing well today .
To be sure , there are many ways we can off@@ er practic@@ al help and comfort to those who mo@@ ur@@ n .
The Bible also com@@ forts us by means of a thr@@ il@@ ling hope for the future .
Some have even mar@@ ked the d@@ ate of the death on their cal@@ en@@ da@@ r as a re@@ min@@ der to off@@ er comfort when it may be most needed ​ — on or near the d@@ ate of the lo@@ ss .
You may rec@@ all that G@@ a@@ il , mentioned ear@@ li@@ er in this seri@@ es , doub@@ ts whether she will ever get over the death of her husband , Ro@@ b .
However , she is look@@ ing for@@ ward to see@@ ing him again in Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s promi@@ sed new world .
My feelings really go out to people who have lost someone they love but who are not awa@@ re of this hope of see@@ ing their loved one again . ”
So@@ on , God will do just that ​ — for Job and coun@@ tl@@ ess others — ​ when this earth is trans@@ form@@ ed into a para@@ dise .
“ There is going to be a resurrection , ” the Bible con@@ fir@@ ms at Acts 24 : 15 .
“ Do not be a@@ ma@@ zed at this , ” Jesus as@@ sures us , “ for the h@@ our is coming in which all those in the me@@ mo@@ ri@@ al t@@ om@@ bs will hear his vo@@ ice and come out . ”
He will have the pro@@ spe@@ ct of re@@ ga@@ ining “ his you@@ th@@ ful vi@@ go@@ r , ” and his f@@ les@@ h will forever remain “ fre@@ sh@@ er than in you@@ th . ”
The same will hap@@ pe@@ n to all who respon@@ d with appreci@@ ation to Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s mer@@ ci@@ ful pro@@ vision of a resurrection to life on earth .
If you have su@@ f@@ fered the lo@@ ss of someone de@@ ar to you , the information we have discu@@ ssed may not comp@@ let@@ ely take away your gri@@ ef .
But by medi@@ t@@ ating on Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s promi@@ ses found in the Bible , you can find real hope and the strength to keep going . ​ — 1 Th@@ es@@ sal@@ on@@ ians 4 : 13 .
W@@ ould you like to learn more about how to c@@ ope with gri@@ ef ?
O@@ r do you have rel@@ ated questions , such as “ Why does God allow evil and suffering ? ”
P@@ lea@@ se vis@@ it our we@@ b@@ s@@ ite , j@@ w@@ .@@ or@@ g , to see how the Bible gives com@@ for@@ ting , practic@@ al ans@@ wers .
“ God . . . will wi@@ pe out every te@@ ar from their eyes , and death will be no more . ” ​ — Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 .
This issue of The Watchtower discu@@ s@@ ses how God will ful@@ f@@ ill that promise and what it can mean for you .

In the sp@@ ring of 33 C.E . , Jesus the Na@@ z@@ ar@@ ene was ex@@ e@@ c@@ ut@@ ed .
He had been fal@@ sel@@ y char@@ ged with se@@ dition , sa@@ v@@ ag@@ ely be@@ at@@ en , and na@@ iled to a sta@@ ke .
But God ra@@ ised him back to life , and 40 days later , Jesus as@@ cen@@ ded to heaven .
This ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ary account comes to us from the four Go@@ sp@@ els of the Christian Greek Scriptures , com@@ mon@@ ly called the New T@@ est@@ am@@ ent .
On the other hand , if those ev@@ ents really did hap@@ pe@@ n , then there is a b@@ right future for mankind , one in which you can share .
So , are the Go@@ spe@@ l accoun@@ ts fact or fic@@ tion ?
Un@@ like f@@ anci@@ ful le@@ gen@@ ds , the Go@@ spe@@ l writ@@ ings refle@@ ct pa@@ inst@@ aking ac@@ cu@@ ra@@ cy and attention to de@@ ta@@ il .
For example , they abo@@ un@@ d with nam@@ es of real plac@@ es , many of which can be vis@@ ited today .
They tell about real people , who@@ se ex@@ ist@@ ence has been cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ated by secu@@ lar his@@ tor@@ ians . ​ — Luke 3 : 1 , 2 , 23 .
Jesus himself is mentioned by secu@@ lar writ@@ ers of the first and second cen@@ tu@@ ries .
* His man@@ ner of death , as descri@@ bed in the Go@@ sp@@ els , ag@@ re@@ es with Roman ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tional me@@ tho@@ ds of the time .
Mo@@ re@@ over , ev@@ ents are rel@@ ated in a fac@@ tu@@ al and can@@ did man@@ ner ​ — even por@@ tra@@ ying some of Jesus ’ disciples un@@ fav@@ or@@ ab@@ ly .
All these fac@@ tors str@@ ong@@ ly indic@@ ate that the Go@@ spe@@ l writ@@ ers were hon@@ est and acc@@ ur@@ ate in what they wrote about Jesus .
While it is gener@@ ally accep@@ ted that Jesus lived and died , some would question his resurrection .
Even his apostles did not believe the in@@ iti@@ al re@@ port of his having re@@ turned to life .
All doub@@ t was re@@ moved , however , when they and other disciples saw the resur@@ rec@@ ted Jesus on se@@ par@@ ate occa@@ sions .
In fact , in one case , there were more than 5@@ 00 e@@ ye@@ witnes@@ ses present . ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 6 .
At the ris@@ k of being ar@@ rest@@ ed and kil@@ led , the disciples cou@@ rag@@ e@@ ously pro@@ claim@@ ed Jesus ’ resurrection to all ​ — even to the very ones who had ex@@ e@@ c@@ ut@@ ed him .
W@@ ould so many disciples have been so bol@@ d if they were not ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely sure that Jesus had really been resur@@ rec@@ ted ?
In fact , the re@@ ality of the resurrection of Jesus is the dri@@ ving for@@ ce be@@ h@@ ind the im@@ p@@ act that Christi@@ an@@ ity has had on the world both then and now .
The Go@@ spe@@ l accoun@@ ts of Jesus ’ death and resurrection be@@ ar all the necess@@ ary mar@@ ks of an au@@ th@@ en@@ tic his@@ tor@@ ical rec@@ ord .
C@@ are@@ fully reading them will con@@ v@@ in@@ ce you that these ev@@ ents really happen@@ ed .
Your con@@ vic@@ tion can be further streng@@ th@@ ened when you understand why they took place .
T@@ ac@@ it@@ us , born about 5@@ 5 C.E . , wrote that “ Chris@@ t@@ us , from whom the name [ Christians ] had its orig@@ in , su@@ f@@ fered the ex@@ tre@@ me pen@@ al@@ ty during the re@@ ign of Ti@@ ber@@ i@@ us at the hands of one of our pro@@ cur@@ at@@ ors , P@@ on@@ ti@@ us P@@ il@@ at@@ us . ”
Jesus is also refer@@ red to by Su@@ et@@ on@@ i@@ us ( first century ) ; Jewish his@@ tor@@ ian Jose@@ ph@@ us ( first century ) ; and P@@ lin@@ y the Y@@ oun@@ ger , govern@@ or of Bi@@ th@@ y@@ n@@ ia ( early second century ) .
Then , too , it is un@@ likely that Jesus ’ many op@@ po@@ ser@@ s would writ@@ e anything that would len@@ d cre@@ di@@ bility to the repor@@ ts about him .
R@@ eg@@ ar@@ ding Jesus ’ resurrection , Peter , one of his apostles , explained : “ God ra@@ ised this one up on the th@@ ir@@ d day and allow@@ ed him to become man@@ i@@ f@@ est , not to all the people , but to witnes@@ ses appoin@@ ted be@@ fore@@ hand by God , to us , who ate and d@@ ran@@ k with him after his ris@@ ing from the dead . ”
Matthe@@ w@@ ’@@ s Go@@ spe@@ l tel@@ ls us that when the religious enem@@ ies heard repor@@ ts of Jesus ’ resurrection , they sc@@ he@@ med to sup@@ pre@@ ss them . ​ — Matthew 28 : 11 - 15 .
Does this mean that Jesus wanted his resurrection to be kept se@@ cre@@ t ?
No , for Peter went on to say : “ He or@@ dered us to pre@@ ach to the people and to give a thor@@ ough witness that this is the one de@@ cre@@ ed by God to be jud@@ ge of the living and the dead . ”
True Christians have done and are doing just that . ​ — Acts 10 : 42 .
“ Th@@ r@@ ough one man [ Adam ] sin en@@ tered into the world and death through sin . ” ​ — Romans 5 : 12
What would you say if you were asked , “ Do you want to live forever ? ”
Mo@@ st people would pro@@ ba@@ bly say that they want to but that they feel it is un@@ real@@ is@@ tic to consider it .
De@@ ath is a nor@@ mal part of life , they say , the natural out@@ come of our ex@@ ist@@ ence .
S@@ up@@ pose , though , that the question were turned around and you were asked , “ Are you ready to die ? ”
Un@@ der nor@@ mal circumstances , most people would answer no .
The Bible shows that God cre@@ ated humans with the desire and the will to live .
In fact , it says that “ he has even put e@@ tern@@ ity in their heart . ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 3 : 11 .
The re@@ ality , though , is that humans do not live forever .
F@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , has God done anything to re@@ me@@ dy the situation ?
The Bi@@ ble@@ ’@@ s ans@@ wers are hear@@ ten@@ ing , and they have a dire@@ ct be@@ aring on why Jesus su@@ f@@ fered and died .
The first three chap@@ ters of the Bible book of Genesis tell us that God set before the first human coup@@ le , Adam and E@@ ve , the pro@@ spe@@ ct of un@@ en@@ ding life and told them what they would have to do to gain it .
Then the account descri@@ bes how they fa@@ iled to obe@@ y God and lost that pro@@ spe@@ ct .
The st@@ ory is told simply ​ — so simply that some are qu@@ ic@@ k to dis@@ mis@@ s it as fol@@ k@@ lo@@ re .
But Genesis , like the Go@@ sp@@ els , gives every indic@@ ation of being a fac@@ tu@@ al , his@@ tor@@ ical rec@@ ord .
What has been the result of Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s fa@@ il@@ ure to obe@@ y ?
The Bible ans@@ wers this way : “ Th@@ r@@ ough one man [ Adam ] sin en@@ tered into the world and death through sin , and so death sp@@ read to all men because they had all sin@@ ned . ”
He thus lost the pro@@ spe@@ ct of end@@ less life and even@@ tually died .
Be@@ ing his des@@ cen@@ d@@ ants , we have in@@ her@@ ited his sin@@ ful con@@ dition .
But has God done anything to re@@ me@@ dy the situation ?
Yes , God made arrang@@ em@@ ents to re@@ de@@ e@@ m , or bu@@ y back , what Adam had lost for his des@@ cen@@ d@@ ants , nam@@ ely , the pro@@ spe@@ ct of end@@ less life .
“ The wa@@ ges sin pa@@ ys is death , ” says the Bible at Romans 6 : 23 .
This means that death is the con@@ sequ@@ ence of sin .
L@@ ike@@ wise , we sin and are therefore sub@@ ject to sin@@ ’@@ s wa@@ ges , death .
But we were born in this sin@@ ful con@@ dition through no fa@@ ul@@ t of our own .
So God lov@@ ingly sent his Son , Jesus , to accept ‘ the wa@@ ges of sin ’ for us .
Jesus ’ death op@@ ens the way to a happy , end@@ less life
Since one man , the perfect man Adam , brought sin and death on us through di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ence , a perfect man obedi@@ ent even till death was needed to rele@@ ase us from that bur@@ den .
The Bible explains it this way : “ Ju@@ st as through the di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ence of the one man many were made sin@@ n@@ ers , so also through the obedi@@ ence of the one person many will be made righteous . ”
He left heaven , became a perfect man * , and died in our be@@ half .
As a result , it is possible for us to have a righteous standing with God and gain the pro@@ spe@@ ct of end@@ less life .
Why , though , was it necess@@ ary for Jesus to die to accom@@ pl@@ ish this ?
C@@ ould not Al@@ mi@@ gh@@ ty God have simply issu@@ ed a de@@ cre@@ e that Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s des@@ cen@@ d@@ ants be allow@@ ed to live forever ?
H@@ ad God set justice a@@ side in this inst@@ ance , people might have won@@ dered whether he would do so in other matters as well .
For example , would he be fa@@ ir in determin@@ ing who among Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s off@@ sp@@ ring qu@@ ali@@ fy for e@@ tern@@ al life ?
C@@ ould he be tru@@ st@@ ed to keep his promi@@ ses ?
Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s ad@@ her@@ ence to justice in working out our sal@@ vation is as@@ sur@@ ance to us that he will always do what is right .
By Jesus ’ sacri@@ fic@@ i@@ al death , God op@@ ened the way to end@@ less life in Para@@ dise on earth .
No@@ te Jesus ’ words as recor@@ ded at John 3 : 16 : “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - be@@ go@@ t@@ ten Son , so that ever@@ yone exer@@ c@@ ising faith in him might not be destro@@ yed but have everlasting life . ”
Jesus ’ death is thus an expre@@ ssion not only of Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s un@@ fa@@ il@@ ing justice but , more speci@@ ally , of his great love for humans .
However , why did Jesus have to suff@@ er and die in the pa@@ in@@ ful way that was descri@@ bed in the Go@@ sp@@ els ?
By sub@@ je@@ cting himself to the ex@@ tre@@ me t@@ est and rema@@ ining faithful , Jesus ref@@ ut@@ ed once and for all the D@@ ev@@ il@@ ’@@ s cla@@ im that humans would not remain loy@@ al to God when under tri@@ al .
That cla@@ im might have seem@@ ed val@@ id after Satan in@@ duced perfect Adam to sin .
But Jesus ​ — who was Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s perfect e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent — ​ rema@@ ined obedi@@ ent des@@ pite se@@ ve@@ re suffering .
He thus proved that Adam too could have obe@@ yed God if he had cho@@ se@@ n to do so .
By en@@ during under tri@@ al , Jesus left us a mo@@ de@@ l to follow .
God re@@ war@@ ded his S@@ on@@ ’@@ s perfect obedi@@ ence , gran@@ ting Jesus im@@ mor@@ tal life in heaven .
Jesus indic@@ ated what we need to do when he said : “ This means everlasting life , their coming to know you , the only true God , and the one whom you sent , Jesus Christ . ” ​ — John 17 : 3 .

[ 1 ] ( par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h 14 ) See chap@@ ter 21 of the book Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s Kingdom Ru@@ les !
During an as@@ sem@@ bly , a brother asked me if I would like to pre@@ ach .
We went to the ter@@ rit@@ ory , and he gave me some book@@ le@@ ts about Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s Kingdom .
One of the sisters there gave us children Bible les@@ sons based on the Bible and the book The H@@ ar@@ p of God .
As a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er , I enjo@@ yed giving people hope from Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s Word .
The brother st@@ op@@ ped his b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le and asked me to si@@ t down with him on a lo@@ g .
He said : “ Who gave you authority to jud@@ ge who is a go@@ at ?
Le@@ t@@ ’@@ s just be happy giving people the good news and leave the judg@@ ing to Jehovah . ”
Ano@@ ther older brother taught me that to find happiness in giving , we some@@ times have to en@@ du@@ re pati@@ ently .
Y@@ ear@@ s later , his pati@@ ence was re@@ war@@ ded when his wife was baptized as one of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
After the war , I pione@@ ere@@ d for two years in sou@@ ther@@ n I@@ rel@@ and .
We did not real@@ ize how much power the pri@@ ests had .

After three we@@ ek@@ s I pro@@ posed , and after si@@ x we@@ ek@@ s we were married .
Ma@@ x@@ ine and I were assign@@ ed as mission@@ aries to Pu@@ er@@ to R@@ ic@@ o , so I never went out on the new bo@@ at .
For example , in the vil@@ la@@ ge of P@@ ot@@ ala P@@ as@@ til@@ lo , there were two Witness families with many children , and I used to pla@@ y the f@@ l@@ ute for them .
I asked one of the little gir@@ ls , H@@ il@@ da , if she wanted to come and pre@@ ach with us .

Let your children see how real Jehovah is to you .

When she se@@ es the out@@ come , she kno@@ ws that Jehovah is help@@ ing us .
This has done won@@ ders for her faith in God and in the Bible . ”
The first article shows how our faith can gro@@ w and remain strong .
Let me expla@@ in what led to that con@@ vers@@ ation .
I W@@ A@@ S born in W@@ ic@@ h@@ it@@ a , K@@ an@@ sa@@ s , U.S@@ .@@ A . , on Dec@@ ember 10 , 19@@ 36 , the ol@@ des@@ t of four children .
Then a sol@@ di@@ er wal@@ ked by , and the do@@ ct@@ or y@@ el@@ led , “ Do something about this y@@ el@@ low co@@ ward ! ”
The sol@@ di@@ er could see that the man was d@@ run@@ k , so he told him , “ Go home and so@@ ber up ! ”
He o@@ w@@ ned two bar@@ ber@@ sho@@ ps in W@@ ic@@ h@@ it@@ a , and the do@@ ct@@ or was one of his c@@ li@@ ents !
With my parents , going to a conven@@ tion in W@@ ic@@ h@@ it@@ a in the 19@@ 40 ’ s
With Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s bles@@ sing and their ze@@ al@@ ous work , a congregation was started .
The brother also s@@ old my c@@ ar for $ 25 .
We were assign@@ ed to special pioneer in W@@ al@@ n@@ ut R@@ id@@ ge , Ar@@ kan@@ sa@@ s .
Then in 19@@ 6@@ 2 , we were thr@@ il@@ led to receive an inv@@ it@@ ation to the 3@@ 7@@ th cla@@ ss of Gi@@ lead .
In the ministry in Na@@ i@@ ro@@ bi with Mary and Ch@@ r@@ is K@@ ana@@ i@@ ya
So@@ on after , our first daugh@@ ter , K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly , was born , and 17 months later , we had S@@ te@@ ph@@ any .
We would also go c@@ amp@@ ing with them and would have very enjo@@ y@@ able con@@ vers@@ ations around the c@@ amp@@ fi@@ re .
We arrang@@ ed to have some who were in the full - time ministry sta@@ y in our home .
They were sho@@ c@@ ked and started to c@@ ry and said that they wanted to study .
With the help and di@@ rection of Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s organization , we did our best to ra@@ ise them to love Jehovah .
On a later tri@@ p , K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly me@@ t one of his work@@ mat@@ es , B@@ ri@@ an L@@ le@@ wel@@ ly@@ n .
So they did sta@@ y free until they were at lea@@ st 23 .
At the same time , B@@ ri@@ an and K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly were inv@@ ited to work at L@@ on@@ don Be@@ the@@ l and later were trans@@ fer@@ red to M@@ ala@@ wi Be@@ the@@ l .
The day after we left for the Watchtower E@@ duc@@ ational C@@ en@@ ter in P@@ at@@ ter@@ son , L@@ in@@ da called to tell us that Mo@@ ther had died .
N@@ ex@@ t , we taught the course in Z@@ im@@ ba@@ b@@ we and then in Z@@ am@@ bi@@ a .
In 200@@ 6 , B@@ ri@@ an and K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly moved next do@@ or to us to ra@@ ise their two daugh@@ ters , M@@ ac@@ k@@ en@@ z@@ i@@ e and Eli@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th .
Paul and S@@ te@@ ph@@ any are still in M@@ ala@@ wi , where Paul ser@@ ves on the B@@ ran@@ ch Com@@ mit@@ te@@ e .
Why might we need to ad@@ just our view of str@@ ang@@ ers ?
When I left the a@@ ir@@ port and felt the c@@ old for the first time in my life , I started c@@ r@@ ying . ”

( b ) How can we re@@ ach our go@@ al ?
We must recogn@@ ize that when we pre@@ pare for the ministry , for the meetings , or for a talk , we may not necess@@ ar@@ ily app@@ ly what we read to ourselves .
Since my mind is main@@ ly involved in an in@@ tel@@ le@@ c@@ tu@@ al exerci@@ se , my heart is not necess@@ ar@@ ily t@@ ou@@ ched by the spiritual though@@ ts I am reading .
That is why I regu@@ larly set a@@ side time to study the Bible and other public@@ ations in my mother ton@@ gue . ”

In what two ways does Hebrews 11 : 1 descri@@ be faith ?
You see that his faith was ac@@ tive along with his works and his faith was per@@ fe@@ cted by his works . ”
For example , John explained : “ The one who exerci@@ ses faith in the Son has everlasting life ; the one who di@@ so@@ be@@ ys the Son will not see life , but the w@@ rat@@ h of God rema@@ ins upon him . ”
Com@@ pa@@ red with love , how important is faith ?

There are many reas@@ ons why we should be than@@ k@@ ful to Jehovah !
It also shows how the hope of a re@@ ward benef@@ its us .
I was only ei@@ ght years old at the time .
My father did not want my mother to talk to me about what she was lear@@ ning .
However , I was cu@@ ri@@ ous and asked questions , so she stu@@ died with me when my father was out of the house .
As a result , I too deci@@ ded that I wanted to dedic@@ ate my life to Jehovah .
My mother said that I should first speak to the serv@@ ant to the b@@ re@@ th@@ re@@ n ( now called a cir@@ cu@@ it overse@@ er ) .
He said , “ Go for it ! ”
After four months , I sele@@ cted a brother as my pioneer par@@ t@@ ner .
My mother pione@@ ere@@ d with a sister in another congregation .
In 195@@ 1 , I fil@@ led out an app@@ li@@ c@@ ation to atten@@ d the Watchtower Bible S@@ chool of Gi@@ lead .
While there , I received my inv@@ it@@ ation to the 2@@ 2@@ n@@ d cla@@ ss of Gi@@ lead .
I then travel@@ ed by tra@@ in to S@@ ou@@ th L@@ an@@ sing , New York , where the school was lo@@ c@@ ated .

How can you experience “ the peace of God ” ?
How can the congregation help you to re@@ du@@ ce an@@ xi@@ ety ?
( See op@@ en@@ ing pic@@ ture . ) ( b ) What will we consider in this article ?
How , though , can you do that ?
The p@@ sal@@ mis@@ t David be@@ gg@@ ed Jehovah : “ L@@ is@@ ten to my prayer , O God . ”
When we are an@@ xi@@ ous , why is prayer so important ?
( Read Matthew 11 : 28 - 30 . )
What did Jesus mean when he said : “ N@@ ever be an@@ xi@@ ous ” ?
He ad@@ mit@@ ted : “ My angu@@ ished heart makes me gro@@ an al@@ ou@@ d . ”
( See the bo@@ x “ Some P@@ ra@@ c@@ tic@@ al W@@ a@@ ys to Re@@ du@@ ce An@@ xi@@ ety . ” )
How can the meaning of Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s name streng@@ then your faith ?
His very name is under@@ sto@@ od to mean “ He C@@ au@@ ses to Be@@ come . ”
Why can you be confi@@ dent that your relationship with God will streng@@ then you ?
( a ) How can we th@@ row our an@@ xi@@ ety on God ?
How can we be sure that Jehovah re@@ war@@ ds his servants ?
How did Jehovah ble@@ ss his servants in the past ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) How are love and faith con@@ ne@@ cted ?
How , though , does the hope of a re@@ ward benefit us ?
Jesus showed that his disciples would be re@@ war@@ ded for their sacri@@ fic@@ es ( See par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h 5 )
The apostle Peter once asked Jesus : “ We have left all things and follow@@ ed you ; what , then , will there be for us ? ”
In the Ser@@ mon on the M@@ oun@@ t , Jesus said : “ Re@@ jo@@ ice and be over@@ jo@@ yed , since your re@@ ward is great in the heavens , for in that way they per@@ se@@ c@@ ut@@ ed the prophe@@ ts pri@@ or to you . ”
Moses told the nation of Israel : “ Jehovah will sur@@ ely ble@@ ss you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to pos@@ se@@ ss as an in@@ her@@ it@@ ance , but only if you stri@@ c@@ tly obe@@ y the vo@@ ice of Jehovah your God and care@@ fully ob@@ serve all this comman@@ d@@ ment that I am giving you today .
For Jehovah your God will ble@@ ss you just as he has promi@@ sed you . ”
And he named the second one E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , for he said , ‘ God has made me fru@@ it@@ ful in the land of my af@@ fli@@ ction . ’ ”
Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s Word explains : “ For the joy that was set before him he en@@ du@@ red a tor@@ ture sta@@ ke , des@@ p@@ ising sha@@ me . ”
Jesus certainly found joy in being able to san@@ c@@ ti@@ fy Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s name .
How does Jehovah feel about what we do for him ?
“ The one sho@@ wing fav@@ or to the low@@ ly is len@@ ding to Jehovah , and He will re@@ pa@@ y him for what he does . ”
What comfort do we find at 1 John 3 : 19 , 20 ?
( Read 1 John 3 : 19 , 20 . )
What are some of the re@@ war@@ ds that we enjoy now ?
How do Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s servants feel about the re@@ war@@ ds they receive ?
For example , Bi@@ an@@ ca from Ger@@ many says : “ I cannot than@@ k Jehovah enough for help@@ ing me with my wor@@ ries and for being at my side each day .
The world out there is cha@@ o@@ tic and ble@@ ak .
But as I work clo@@ sel@@ y with Jehovah , I feel secu@@ re in his ar@@ ms .
Wh@@ en@@ ever I make personal sacri@@ fic@@ es for him , he gives me back a hun@@ dre@@ d@@ f@@ old in bles@@ s@@ ings . ”
For my own encourag@@ ement , I keep a no@@ te@@ book with s@@ criptu@@ res and though@@ ts from our public@@ ations that I can con@@ sul@@ t from time to time .
I call it ‘ My S@@ ur@@ vi@@ val No@@ te@@ book . ’
Dis@@ cou@@ rag@@ ement is temp@@ or@@ ary if we fo@@ c@@ us on Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s promi@@ ses .
Jehovah is always there to help us , regar@@ d@@ less of our circumstances . ”
Yet , you can likely think of ways in which Jehovah has re@@ war@@ ded you and those around you .

The Ju@@ ly 15 , 20@@ 13 , issue of The Watchtower explained that “ the faithful and dis@@ cre@@ et slave ” is a small group of anointed brothers who make up the Go@@ ver@@ ning Bo@@ dy .
So how can we answer Jesus ’ question : “ Who really is the faithful and dis@@ cre@@ et slave ? ”
How has holy spirit helped the Go@@ ver@@ ning Bo@@ dy ?
What is one way to re@@ member the Go@@ ver@@ ning Bo@@ dy ?
Why are you determin@@ ed to follow our Le@@ ad@@ er , Jesus ?

3 , 4 . ( a ) How can parents set a good example for their children ?
( b ) What should parents not expe@@ ct of their children ?
When your children see you “ se@@ ek@@ ing first the Kingdom , ” they learn to de@@ p@@ end on Jehovah for their da@@ ily needs .
N@@ ever get so bu@@ s@@ y that you do not have time for your children .
How may your children benefit from lear@@ ning your language ?
Par@@ ents , if that descri@@ bes your children , can you learn at lea@@ st some of the local language ?
A child who commun@@ ic@@ ates best in another sp@@ ok@@ en language de@@ ser@@ ves the same concer@@ n , would you not ag@@ ree ?
If that is your situation , you can still help your children to come to know and love Jehovah .
“ But when we saw her stud@@ ying , pra@@ ying , and doing her best to conduct family worship every we@@ ek , we under@@ sto@@ od that g@@ etting to know Jehovah was very important . ”
How can parents help children who may need to study in two langu@@ ages ?
( a ) Who must deci@@ de which language congregation to atten@@ d ?
That may not be the case when children do not fully understand the language .
( Read 1 Corinthians 14 : 9 , 11 . )
The answer was not what we person@@ ally found conven@@ i@@ ent .
But when we saw that they were g@@ etting little benefit from the meetings in our language , we deci@@ ded to move to the local - language congregation .
To@@ gether , we regu@@ larly atten@@ ded meetings and sha@@ red in the ministry .
We also inv@@ ited local friends to jo@@ in us for me@@ als and exc@@ ur@@ sions .
All of this helped our children to get to know the brothers and to get to know Jehovah , not only as their God but also as their Father and F@@ ri@@ end .
We consi@@ dered this to be much more important than their ma@@ st@@ ering our language . ”
Samuel ad@@ ds : “ To keep ourselves spiritually strong , my wife and I also atten@@ ded meetings in our language .
Life was very bu@@ s@@ y , and we were ti@@ red .
But we than@@ k Jehovah for bles@@ sing our efforts and sacri@@ fic@@ es .
Our three children are all serving Jehovah in the full - time ministry . ”
“ I knew the ba@@ si@@ c@@ s of my parents ’ language , but the language sp@@ ok@@ en at the meetings was over my head , ” rec@@ al@@ ls K@@ ris@@ t@@ ina .
“ When I was 12 , I atten@@ ded a conven@@ tion in my school language .
For the first time , I under@@ sto@@ od that what I was hear@@ ing was the truth !
Ano@@ ther tur@@ ning point came when I began to pray in my school language .
I could speak to Jehovah from my heart ! ”
Y@@ oun@@ g people , do you think that you would pre@@ f@@ er being part of a local - language congregation ?
“ When my si@@ bl@@ ings and I got into our te@@ ens , we wanted to s@@ w@@ it@@ ch to the local - language congregation , ” says Na@@ dia , who now ser@@ ves at Be@@ the@@ l .
“ Now we@@ ’@@ re g@@ rat@@ e@@ ful that our parents wor@@ ked hard to teach us their language and kept us in the fore@@ ign - language congregation .
It has en@@ ri@@ ched our lives and bro@@ ad@@ ened our opport@@ un@@ ities to help others get to know Jehovah . ”
( b ) How can parents get help in teaching their children the truth ?
( Read Proverbs 1 : 8 ; 31 : 10 , 27 , 28 . )
S@@ till , parents who do not know the local language may need help to re@@ ach their chil@@ d@@ ren@@ ’@@ s heart .
Bo@@ th children and parents benefit from associ@@ ation with the congregation ( See par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s 18 , 19 )
( b ) What must parents continue to do ?
“ When they helped me with stud@@ ent talk assign@@ ments for the meeting , I always learned more .
And I enjo@@ yed the le@@ is@@ ure activ@@ ities we sha@@ red in as a group . ”
Par@@ ents , pray to Jehovah for help , and try your best .

Jesus said : “ Do not fear those who k@@ ill the body and after this are not able to do anything more . ”
Do not be stru@@ ck with ter@@ ro@@ r or fear , for Jehovah your God is with you whe@@ re@@ ver you go . ”
L@@ is@@ ten to Jehovah and trust in him in all that you do .
The second article high@@ ligh@@ ts how Jehovah can do the u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted by accom@@ pl@@ ish@@ ing things we could never i@@ mag@@ ine .
Like the far@@ m@@ er , we need to wa@@ it pati@@ ently .
What can we learn from the example of the prophet Mic@@ ah ?
( Read Mic@@ ah 7 : 1 - 3 . )
If we have faith like that of Mic@@ ah , we will be wil@@ ling to wa@@ it for Jehovah .
So we “ en@@ du@@ re fully with pati@@ ence and joy . ”
Abraham had to wa@@ it many years before his gran@@ d@@ sons E@@ sa@@ u and J@@ ac@@ o@@ b were born ( See par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s 9 , 10 )
( Read Hebrews 11 : 8 - 12 . )
But just i@@ mag@@ ine Abra@@ ha@@ m@@ ’@@ s joy when he is resur@@ rec@@ ted back to a para@@ dise earth .
Although you me@@ ant to har@@ m me , God inten@@ ded it to turn out well and to pre@@ serve many people ali@@ ve , as he is doing today . ”
( b ) What helped David to wa@@ it pati@@ ently ?
I will sing to Jehovah , for he has ri@@ ch@@ ly re@@ war@@ ded me . ”
( Read 2 Peter 3 : 9 . )
What will help us to be wil@@ ling to wa@@ it pati@@ ently ?
What les@@ sons do we learn from what happen@@ ed to the apostle Paul in Philip@@ pi ?
( Read Acts 16 : 8 - 10 . )
So@@ on after he arri@@ ved in M@@ ac@@ e@@ don@@ ia , he en@@ ded up in pris@@ on !
Why did Jehovah allow this to hap@@ pe@@ n to Paul ?
Bo@@ th he and S@@ il@@ as started “ pra@@ ying and pra@@ ising God with song . ”
4 , 5 . ( a ) How could our situation be similar to that of Paul ?
( b ) How did Pau@@ l@@ ’@@ s situation change u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ c@@ te@@ dly ?
What will we now discu@@ ss and re@@ view together ?
( Read 1 Peter 5 : 6 , 7 . )
So@@ me@@ times he sur@@ pri@@ ses us by doing the u@@ ne@@ x@@ pe@@ cted .
Jehovah sent an ang@@ el to destro@@ y 18@@ 5@@ ,000 of Sen@@ n@@ ach@@ eri@@ b@@ ’@@ s sol@@ di@@ ers in one night .
( a ) What les@@ son do we learn from what happen@@ ed to Joseph ?
No doub@@ t Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s ac@@ tions ex@@ ce@@ e@@ ded all of Jose@@ ph@@ ’@@ s expe@@ ct@@ ations .
Th@@ in@@ k , too , about Jose@@ ph@@ ’@@ s great - gran@@ d@@ mother S@@ ar@@ ah .
( Read Isaiah 43 : 10 - 13 . )
We know that Jehovah ca@@ res for us and wan@@ ts us to succ@@ e@@ ed .
How can we stri@@ p off and keep off the old person@@ ality ?
By 19@@ 39 there were 6@@ ,000 of them in the [ con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ation c@@ amp@@ s ] . ”
And you people have cle@@ an@@ ed the sta@@ di@@ um so n@@ ic@@ ely .
But most of all , you are truly mu@@ l@@ ti@@ ra@@ ci@@ al . ”
But the more I had sex@@ ual rel@@ ations , the more in@@ secu@@ re I felt . ”
This way of life continued until S@@ ak@@ ura was 23 years old .
It got so bad that I could not wa@@ it for the woman I was living with to leave the house so that I could wat@@ ch por@@ no@@ gra@@ phi@@ c vi@@ de@@ o@@ s . ”
What helped S@@ te@@ p@@ hen to put away anger and abu@@ sive spe@@ e@@ ch ?
He says : “ Our family life im@@ proved dra@@ m@@ ati@@ c@@ ally .
Today , S@@ te@@ p@@ hen ser@@ ves as a minis@@ ter@@ i@@ al serv@@ ant , and his wife has been a regu@@ lar pioneer for sever@@ al years .
Bible te@@ x@@ ts that encourag@@ ed me were Isaiah 5@@ 5 : 7 , which says : ‘ Let the wicked man leave his way , ’ and 1 Corinthians 6 : 11 , which says about those who had a@@ ban@@ don@@ ed sin@@ ful ways : ‘ And yet that is what some of you were . ’
For many years , Jehovah pati@@ ently helped me by means of his holy spirit to put on the new person@@ ality . ”
We also benefit from Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s Word and his holy spirit when we pre@@ pare for and atten@@ d congregation meetings .
See chap@@ ter 25 in the book Q@@ u@@ es@@ tions Y@@ oun@@ g People As@@ k ​ — An@@ s@@ wers That Wor@@ k , V@@ ol@@ u@@ me 1 .
( Read C@@ olo@@ ssi@@ ans 3 : 10 - 14 . )
He st@@ ated : “ There is ne@@ i@@ ther Greek nor Je@@ w , circum@@ c@@ ision nor un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision , fore@@ ign@@ er , S@@ cy@@ thi@@ an , slave , or free@@ man . ”
( a ) How do servants of Jehovah need to tre@@ at others ?
( See op@@ en@@ ing pic@@ ture . ) ( b ) What have been the resul@@ ts ?
Then he atten@@ ded a meeting of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
You get to experience our world@@ wide bro@@ ther@@ ho@@ od and see its mi@@ ra@@ cul@@ ous unity fir@@ s@@ th@@ and . ”
When we showed them s@@ criptu@@ res from their P@@ or@@ tu@@ gu@@ e@@ se Bible , such as Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 or Psalm 37 : 10 , 11 , 29 , they pa@@ id attention and some@@ times even sh@@ ed te@@ ars . ”
We are so than@@ k@@ ful to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Acts 10 : 34 , 35 .
What example did Jesus set in sho@@ wing mil@@ dness and pati@@ ence ?
Ju@@ st as Jehovah fre@@ ely for@@ gave you , you must also do the same . ”
Then he ad@@ ded : “ If you continue sho@@ wing fav@@ or@@ it@@ ism , you are comm@@ it@@ ting sin . ”
Why is it important that we clo@@ the ourselves with love ?
Lo@@ ve is also “ pati@@ ent and kind ” and “ does not get pu@@ ff@@ ed up . ”
Paul said that without love , he was “ nothing . ”
The love is in this respect , not that we have loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son as a pro@@ p@@ iti@@ at@@ ory sacrifice for our sin@@ s . ”
Jesus said : “ No one has love greater than this , that someone should sur@@ ren@@ der his life in be@@ half of his friends . ”
Let us consider how we can do so .
John wrote : “ L@@ it@@ tle children , we should love , not in word or with the ton@@ gue , but in deed and truth . ”
But then I asked my@@ self , ‘ How can I imit@@ ate Jesus in de@@ al@@ ing with this person ? ’
After refle@@ cting on what Jesus would have done , I deci@@ ded to let the matter go and not make an issue of it .
L@@ ater , I learned that my co@@ work@@ er had been cop@@ ing with a serious health problem and was under a lo@@ t of stre@@ ss .
I conc@@ lud@@ ed that she pro@@ ba@@ bly did not really mean what she wrote .
R@@ ef@@ le@@ cting on Jesus ’ example of sho@@ wing love even when pro@@ v@@ ok@@ ed helped me to show similar love to my co@@ work@@ er . ”
By lea@@ ving heaven , “ he emp@@ ti@@ ed himself ” in our be@@ half , even “ to the point of death . ”
P@@ E@@ A@@ C@@ E : “ P@@ ut@@ ting up with one another in love ” al@@ lo@@ ws us to enjoy “ the un@@ iting bon@@ d of peace . ”
W@@ ould you not ag@@ ree that such a pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful spirit is truly uni@@ qu@@ e in to@@ da@@ y@@ ’@@ s divi@@ ded world ?
Paul wrote : “ Lo@@ ve buil@@ ds up . ”
The following day , they had out@@ gro@@ wn the ven@@ u@@ e . ”
B@@ elo@@ w the pic@@ ture was the cap@@ tion : “ In@@ v@@ a@@ sion of the st@@ ree@@ ts . ”

( Read Exodus 34 : 5 - 7 . )
( b ) Why should you be interest@@ ed in what the Bible says about comp@@ as@@ sion ?
( a ) Why did Jehovah sen@@ d ang@@ els to So@@ dom ?
( Read Exodus 22 : 26 , 27 . )
We read : “ Jehovah the God of their fore@@ fa@@ thers kept war@@ ning them by means of his mes@@ sen@@ g@@ ers , war@@ ning them again and again , because he felt comp@@ as@@ sion for his people and for his d@@ wel@@ ling place . ”
“ He started to teach them many things . ”
In@@ stead , we need to do all we can now to help people .
One meaning of comp@@ as@@ sion is “ to suff@@ er together . ”
“ Be cou@@ rag@@ e@@ ous and strong and go to work .
How can young ones and their parents show cou@@ rage ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What important assign@@ ment did Solomon receive ?

Let us consider two are@@ as of life where we need cou@@ rage : in our family and in the congregation .

With the help of her parents and others in the congregation , this young Christian ac@@ hi@@ ev@@ ed her go@@ al of be@@ coming a regu@@ lar pioneer .
How can Psalm 37 : 25 and Hebrews 13 : 5 help parents ?
( Read Psalm 37 : 25 ; Hebrews 13 : 5 . )
A brother who has two children wrote : “ Many parents exp@@ end much effort and res@@ our@@ ces help@@ ing their children re@@ ach go@@ als in such are@@ as as sp@@ or@@ ts , rec@@ re@@ ation , and educ@@ ation .
It makes so much more sense to exp@@ end effort and res@@ our@@ ces in help@@ ing our children re@@ ach go@@ als that will help them to main@@ tain a good standing with Jehovah .
It has been a great s@@ ource of satis@@ fac@@ tion not only to see our children re@@ ach spiritual go@@ als but to share the j@@ our@@ ne@@ y with them . ”
Gi@@ ve examp@@ les of cou@@ rage in the Christian congregation .
( a ) How can baptized brothers be cou@@ rag@@ e@@ ous ?
( Read Philip@@ pi@@ ans 2 : 13 ; 4 : 13 . )
We ur@@ ge all baptized brothers to be cou@@ rag@@ e@@ ous and work hard for the congregation !
The@@ refore , “ be cou@@ rag@@ e@@ ous . . . and go to work . ”

“ I was un@@ able to s@@ le@@ ep that night .

I was born on Ju@@ ly 29 , 19@@ 29 , and gre@@ w up in a vil@@ la@@ ge in the pro@@ v@@ in@@ ce of B@@ ul@@ ac@@ an in the Philip@@ p@@ ines .
I enjo@@ yed reading the Bible , especially the four Go@@ sp@@ els .
Do@@ ing so made me want to follow Jesus ’ example . ​ — John 10 : 27 .
Abo@@ ut that time , my parents asked me to come back home .
One older Witness came to our house and explained what the Bible says about “ the last days . ”
He inv@@ ited us to atten@@ d a Bible study in a ne@@ ar@@ by vil@@ la@@ ge .
We sp@@ ent most of that night discu@@ s@@ sing the Bible .
I re@@ pli@@ ed , “ Yes , I do . ”
I knew that I wanted to “ slave for the Ma@@ ster , Christ . ”
We went to a ne@@ ar@@ by ri@@ ver , and two of us got baptized on F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary 15 , 19@@ 46 .
The C@@ ru@@ z family inv@@ ited me to live with them in An@@ ga@@ t .
He spo@@ ke in English , and af@@ ter@@ ward I gave a su@@ m@@ mar@@ y of his talk in T@@ ag@@ alo@@ g .
In the early mor@@ ning , I helped in the k@@ it@@ c@@ hen .
After I gra@@ du@@ ated , I was temp@@ or@@ ar@@ ily assign@@ ed as a special pioneer in the B@@ ron@@ x in New York C@@ ity .
We sp@@ ent the first we@@ ek after our we@@ d@@ ding vis@@ iting a congregation on R@@ ap@@ u R@@ ap@@ u Is@@ land .
We were even able to bu@@ y the pro@@ per@@ ty from the man who had said that “ Ch@@ ine@@ se do not sel@@ l . ”

I@@ U@@ D@@ s with less cop@@ per will be less effe@@ ctive . ”
( a ) What does “ per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed to believe ” mean ?

Does the Bi@@ ble@@ ’@@ s ex@@ plan@@ ation make sense to them ?
What should be an important part of your teaching ?
S@@ te@@ ph@@ ani@@ e , the mother of three daugh@@ ters , says : “ E@@ ver since my children were very young , I have had to ask my@@ self , ‘ Do I talk to my children about why I am con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s ex@@ ist@@ ence , his love , and the righ@@ t@@ ness of his ways ?
Can my children c@@ learly see that I really love Jehovah ? ’
I can@@ ’@@ t expe@@ ct my children to be per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed un@@ less I am . ”
That kind of wisdom is necess@@ ary for sal@@ vation .

I should feel free to do the same .
So I@@ ’@@ l@@ l men@@ tion something in pas@@ sing , such as , ‘ I was teaching the Bible the other day , and . . . ’
Then I continue with the point of my st@@ ory .
Although the im@@ medi@@ ate point is not in itself about the Bible , often others are cu@@ ri@@ ous about what I do when teaching the Bible .
The more I use this appro@@ ach , the e@@ a@@ si@@ er it ge@@ ts .

We are the only Witnesses they are ex@@ posed to .
So the way we act can deter@@ m@@ ine how they will respon@@ d .
What if we are sh@@ y or ti@@ mi@@ d or have a hard time speaking up about our faith , or what if we c@@ r@@ ing@@ e when we do speak up ?
Then they may look at us as if we ar@@ en@@ ’@@ t p@@ r@@ ou@@ d of who we are .
They may even respon@@ d un@@ kin@@ dly because of our l@@ ack of confi@@ dence .
However , if we talk with e@@ ase and as@@ sur@@ ance about what we believe , making it a nor@@ mal part of con@@ vers@@ ation , it@@ ’@@ s more likely that they will respect us . ”

How does the organization use the money that is don@@ ated today ?
What do we show Jehovah when we support his work ?
( Read 2 Corinthians 8 : 18 - 21 . )
Your don@@ ations help our world@@ wide work ( See par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s 14 - 16 )
As a result , we some@@ times feel is@@ ol@@ ated , and we eas@@ ily for@@ get the sc@@ ope of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s work .

He wrote : “ So that I do not become satis@@ fied and den@@ y you and say , ‘ Who is Jehovah ? ’ ”
She would say , ‘ I have the gre@@ at@@ est bo@@ ss ever ! ’
Now that I too am pione@@ ering , we both work for the same Per@@ son , Jehovah . ”
How can we avoid be@@ coming lov@@ ers of money ?
It means that they do not love God at all . ”
How can we avoid be@@ coming lov@@ ers of plea@@ sures ?
We also know that love “ does not bra@@ g , does not get pu@@ ff@@ ed up . ”
I could see that they ca@@ red for me , and that made me want to plea@@ se them . ”

( Read Daniel 6 : 7 - 10 . )
( Read Job 31 : 24 - 28 . )
( Read Psalm 11 : 5 ; 26 : 4 . )
So ask yourself , ‘ Do I know Jehovah as well as No@@ ah , Daniel , and Job did ? ’
No@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s great - gran@@ d@@ father E@@ no@@ ch also “ kept wal@@ king with the true God . ”
Jesus said : “ Abraham your father re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed gre@@ a@@ tly at the pro@@ spe@@ ct of see@@ ing my day . ”
I@@ t@@ ’@@ s hard for me to expre@@ ss the joy we feel . ”
For it is to us God has reve@@ al@@ ed them through his spirit . ”
Jesus said : “ These things I have sp@@ ok@@ en to you , so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be made full . ”
( 3 ) How will our effort to have “ the mind of Christ ” help us to be spiritual people ?
( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 14 - 16 . )
What does the Bible say about spiritually - min@@ ded people ?
What can we learn from the example of J@@ ac@@ o@@ b ?
What can we learn from the example of Mary ?
( Read Luke 1 : 46 - 5@@ 5 . )
( Read Isaiah 6@@ 3 : 9 ; Mark 6 : 34 . )
R@@ ac@@ he@@ l , a sister in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il , says : “ I loved to follow the world@@ ’@@ s fa@@ shi@@ ons .

But lear@@ ning the truth moved me to make the needed effort to be a spiritual person .
M@@ aking chang@@ es was not eas@@ y , but I became hap@@ pi@@ er and found real purpose in life . ”
So being like Jesus makes us more like Jehovah .
They said : “ We are witnes@@ ses of all the things he did . ”
How will having the mind of Christ af@@ fect your da@@ ily life ?
He says : “ I never did anything wrong , but I was just going through the mo@@ tions .
I look@@ ed spiritually strong , being at all the meetings and serving as an au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary pioneer a few times a year .
He says : “ It was as if I knew nothing .
I thought to my@@ self , ‘ If I am going to be my wi@@ fe@@ ’@@ s spiritual head , I have to do something . ’ ”
( 3 ) How can strong spiritu@@ ality help us in our da@@ ily life ?

5 , 6 . ( a ) The Bi@@ ble@@ ’@@ s des@@ crip@@ tion of Timothy lea@@ ds us to what conclu@@ sion about his bap@@ t@@ ism ?
( Read C@@ olo@@ ssi@@ ans 1 : 9 , 10 . )
He told Jehovah that he was so happy about his little gir@@ l@@ ’@@ s dec@@ ision to dedic@@ ate her life to H@@ im . ”
( Read 1 Peter 3 : 20 , 21 . )
Why do we not pres@@ sure anyone to get baptized ?
If you are a par@@ ent , you may have asked yourself : ‘ Is my child really ready to get baptized ?
The first question is , “ On the bas@@ is of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ , have you re@@ pen@@ ted of your sin@@ s and dedic@@ ated yourself to Jehovah to do his will ? ”
How can we be ho@@ sp@@ it@@ able at our Christian meetings ?
( Read 3 John 5 - 8 . )
He writ@@ es : “ I h@@ es@@ it@@ ated in@@ iti@@ ally because we were new@@ ly married and living in a small house .
But having stud@@ ents sta@@ y with us was truly a jo@@ y@@ ous experience .
As new@@ ly@@ we@@ ds , we were able to see how happy a coup@@ le can be when they serve Jehovah and pursu@@ e spiritual go@@ als together . ”
Why may those who are new to your congregation need ho@@ sp@@ it@@ ality ?
( Read Luke 10 : 41 , 42 . )
One even@@ ing my wife was particu@@ larly ho@@ mes@@ ic@@ k , and my efforts to help were not working .
Then , about 7 : 30 p@@ .@@ m . , we heard a kno@@ ck on the do@@ or .
There sto@@ od a Bible stud@@ ent who brought us three or@@ ang@@ es .

Ano@@ ther el@@ der writ@@ es : “ Ha@@ ving friends from the congregation to my home help@@ s me to understand them better and gives me time to get to know them , especially how they came into the truth . ”
The wife of one of the instru@@ c@@ tors really put me at e@@ ase .
She said that when she and her husband are serving in the travel@@ ing work , their best we@@ ek@@ s are those sp@@ ent sta@@ ying with a spiritual person who may not have much materi@@ ally but who has the same fo@@ c@@ us as they have ​ — serving Jehovah and keep@@ ing life simp@@ le .
This re@@ min@@ ded me of what my mu@@ m used to say to us as children : ‘ B@@ et@@ ter a dis@@ h of v@@ eg@@ e@@ ta@@ b@@ les where the@@ re@@ ’@@ s love . ’ ”

G@@ ra@@ ham began to see himself c@@ learly in the m@@ ir@@ ro@@ r of Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s Word , and he did not like what he saw !
After ac@@ knowled@@ g@@ ing that he had been bl@@ in@@ ded by a ‘ ra@@ f@@ ter ’ of pri@@ de and that his crit@@ ical attitude was his problem , he began to change qu@@ ick@@ ly for the better .
He started to atten@@ d Christian meetings regu@@ larly , to study Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s Word ear@@ nes@@ tly , and to make da@@ ily prayer a hab@@ it .
‘ I@@ ’@@ ve known the truth for years , ’ he said , ‘ and I@@ ’@@ ve even served as a pioneer .

( b ) How did one family benefit from the parents ’ obedi@@ ence to Jehovah ?
( b ) How can we make the elders ’ work more ple@@ as@@ ant for them ?
They did not ber@@ ate me or crit@@ ic@@ ize me , but they encourag@@ ed me and streng@@ th@@ ened me .
After every congregation meeting , no matter how bu@@ s@@ y they were , at lea@@ st one of them would ask how I was .
Because of my past , I found it difficult to feel wor@@ thy of Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s love .
Ti@@ me and time again , however , Jehovah has used the congregation and the elders to con@@ fir@@ m his love for me .
I pray that I will never let him go . ”
If you turn to doing good , will you not be rest@@ o@@ red to fav@@ or ?

D@@ U@@ R@@ IN@@ G my school years , not much chang@@ ed .
The to@@ wn of Li@@ ber@@ ty was sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by small far@@ ms , and the ba@@ sic cro@@ p was cor@@ n .
She took us to the Bap@@ t@@ ist church every S@@ un@@ day .
They wanted me to make the mil@@ it@@ ary my care@@ er .
This time , however , they inv@@ ited me to come to a Con@@ greg@@ ation Bo@@ ok S@@ tu@@ dy , a small meeting for Bible study and discu@@ ssion that was held in their home .
I told them I would think about it .
I cou@@ ld@@ n@@ ’@@ t believe how much they knew about the Bible !
Y@@ ear@@ s before , when I asked my mother about Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , she simply said , “ O@@ h , they worship some old man named Jehovah . ”
But I now felt that my eyes were being op@@ ened !
I started pione@@ ering the next year , in 195@@ 8 .
G@@ lor@@ ia was a je@@ we@@ l then , and she is a je@@ we@@ l today .
G@@ lor@@ ia and I got married in F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary of 195@@ 9 .
A de@@ ar brother , Si@@ mon K@@ ra@@ k@@ er , inter@@ vie@@ wed us .
He told us that Be@@ the@@ l was not accep@@ ting married coup@@ les at that time .
Mo@@ st of our jo@@ bs pa@@ id three d@@ ol@@ l@@ ars a day .
E@@ ach we@@ ek , G@@ lor@@ ia did ir@@ on@@ ing for one family .
I re@@ member one time when we st@@ op@@ ped at a ga@@ s st@@ ation .
On the other hand , we had wonder@@ ful times with the brothers , and we loved our ministry !
Me@@ an@@ while , I started a study with the coup@@ le@@ ’@@ s daugh@@ ter and her husband .
Mo@@ ther and daugh@@ ter both deci@@ ded to serve Jehovah and got baptized .
We had de@@ ar friends in the wh@@ ite congregation .
The K@@ u K@@ lu@@ x K@@ l@@ an ( K@@ K@@ K ) , an organization that pro@@ mo@@ tes ra@@ c@@ ism and viol@@ ence , was very ac@@ tive then .
In 19@@ 6@@ 2 , I was inv@@ ited to atten@@ d the Kingdom M@@ in@@ is@@ try S@@ chool at S@@ ou@@ th L@@ an@@ sing , New York .
However , a t@@ ele@@ ph@@ one comp@@ any in P@@ ine B@@ lu@@ f@@ f had inter@@ vie@@ wed me for a jo@@ b .
If they hi@@ red me , I would be the first bl@@ ack man to work for that comp@@ any .
I had no money to tra@@ v@@ el to New York .
She said , “ Go to school and learn as much as you can , and come back and teach us ! ”
I am so g@@ la@@ d that I did not take that jo@@ b !
He@@ re is how G@@ lor@@ ia re@@ members our time in P@@ ine B@@ lu@@ f@@ f : “ I fel@@ l in love with the ter@@ rit@@ ory !
So we would go in the house - to - house work in the mor@@ ning and then conduct Bible stu@@ dies the rest of the day , some@@ times until 11 o@@ ’@@ clo@@ ck at night .

After I was appoin@@ ted , Bro@@ ther Tho@@ mp@@ son was the first dist@@ ri@@ ct overse@@ er I served with .
In those days , a cir@@ cu@@ it overse@@ er received little tra@@ ining .

I told the off@@ ic@@ er that I had already been in pris@@ on because I would not fi@@ ght .
I W@@ A@@ S born in 19@@ 26 in C@@ ro@@ ok@@ s@@ vil@@ le , O@@ hi@@ o , in the United States .
Father and Mo@@ ther were not religious , but they told us ei@@ ght children to go to church .
Mar@@ ga@@ re@@ t W@@ al@@ k@@ er ( second sister from the left ) helped me learn the truth
Abo@@ ut that time , a neigh@@ bo@@ r named Mar@@ ga@@ re@@ t W@@ al@@ k@@ er , one of Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , began vis@@ iting my mother and tal@@ king to her about the Bible .
But I kept tr@@ ying to lis@@ ten to their discu@@ ssions .
After a coup@@ le more vis@@ its , Mar@@ ga@@ re@@ t asked me , “ Do you know what Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s name is ? ”
I said , “ E@@ ver@@ yone kno@@ ws that ​ — it@@ ’@@ s God . ”
She said , “ G@@ et your Bible and look up Psalm 8@@ 3 : 18 . ”
I did , and I dis@@ co@@ vered that Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s name is Jehovah .
I ra@@ n out to my friends and told them , “ When you get home ton@@ ight , look up Psalm 8@@ 3 : 18 in the Bible and see what Go@@ d@@ ’@@ s name is . ”
You might say I started witnes@@ sing right away .
I stu@@ died the Bible and got baptized in 19@@ 41 .
So@@ on af@@ ter@@ ward , I was assign@@ ed to conduct a congregation book study .
I encourag@@ ed my mother and si@@ bl@@ ings to come , and they all began atten@@ ding the book study that I condu@@ cted .
So@@ me@@ times when she was on her way , he cha@@ sed after her and pu@@ l@@ led her back into the house .
But she would just ru@@ n out the other do@@ or and go to the meeting .
I also told the off@@ ici@@ als that I would not become a sol@@ di@@ er .
In cour@@ t two we@@ ek@@ s later , the jud@@ ge said : “ If it were up to me , I@@ ’@@ d give you a life sen@@ t@@ ence .
I re@@ pli@@ ed : “ Your H@@ on@@ or , I should have been cla@@ ssi@@ fied as a minis@@ ter .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one@@ ’@@ s do@@ or@@ st@@ ep is my pu@@ l@@ p@@ it , and I have pre@@ ached the good news of the Kingdom to many people . ”
The jud@@ ge told the j@@ ur@@ y : “ You are not here to deci@@ de whether this young man is a minis@@ ter or not .
You are here to deci@@ de whether he repor@@ ted for in@@ du@@ ction into the ar@@ my or not . ”
I pra@@ yed to Jehovah : “ I cannot sta@@ y in a c@@ ell for five years .

I wal@@ ked over to a t@@ all , bro@@ ad - sh@@ ou@@ l@@ dered pris@@ on@@ er , and we sto@@ od there look@@ ing out a w@@ in@@ do@@ w .

I said , “ Jehov@@ a@@ h@@ ’@@ s Witnesses don@@ ’@@ t go to war and k@@ ill people . ”
I said , “ No , it do@@ es@@ n@@ ’@@ t . ”
Then he said , “ For 15 years I was in another pris@@ on , where I read some of your liter@@ ature . ”
I was among the Witnesses im@@ pris@@ on@@ ed for ne@@ ut@@ r@@ ality at A@@ sh@@ land , K@@ en@@ tu@@ ck@@ y
That is how we pre@@ ached in an organ@@ ized way .
I wor@@ ri@@ ed about my family because D@@ ad had told me , “ If I can get ri@@ d of you , I can h@@ and@@ le the rest . ”
After my rele@@ ase , I had a ple@@ as@@ ant sur@@ pri@@ se .
I said , “ Th@@ at@@ ’@@ s fine , but I am not going into the ar@@ my . ”
I qu@@ o@@ ted 2 Timothy 2 : 3 and said , “ I am already a sol@@ di@@ er of Christ . ”
After a long sil@@ ence , he said , “ You can leave . ”
So@@ on af@@ ter@@ ward , I atten@@ ded the Be@@ the@@ l meeting at a conven@@ tion in C@@ inc@@ in@@ n@@ at@@ i , O@@ hi@@ o .
I also wor@@ ked at As@@ sem@@ bly H@@ al@@ ls in New York C@@ ity .
I have made many friends at Be@@ the@@ l and in the congregation .
I have learned a little M@@ and@@ ar@@ in Ch@@ ine@@ se and enjoy appro@@ aching Ch@@ ine@@ se people on the stre@@ et .
Some mor@@ n@@ ings I place 30 or 40 magaz@@ ines with interest@@ ed ones .
P@@ re@@ aching to the Ch@@ ine@@ se people in Bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n , New York
I have even made a return vis@@ it in Ch@@ ina !
She took them and told me that her name was K@@ ati@@ e .
After that , wh@@ en@@ ever she saw me , K@@ ati@@ e came over to talk to me .
I taught her the nam@@ es of fru@@ its and v@@ eg@@ e@@ ta@@ b@@ les in English , and she re@@ pe@@ ated the words after me .
I also explained Bible te@@ x@@ ts to her , and she accep@@ ted the Bible T@@ each book .
After some we@@ ek@@ s , though , she dis@@ appe@@ a@@ red .
The next we@@ ek , she h@@ an@@ ded me her c@@ ell ph@@ one and said , “ You talk to Ch@@ ina . ”
I said , “ I don@@ ’@@ t know any@@ body in Ch@@ ina . ”
But she in@@ sis@@ ted , so I took the ph@@ one and said , “ H@@ el@@ lo , this is R@@ ob@@ is@@ on . ”
The vo@@ ice at the other end said , “ R@@ ob@@ by , this is K@@ ati@@ e .
P@@ lea@@ se teach her the way you taught me . ”
I said , “ K@@ ati@@ e , I will do the best I can .
Th@@ an@@ ks for let@@ ting me know where you are . ”
So@@ on af@@ ter@@ ward , I spo@@ ke to K@@ ati@@ e@@ ’@@ s sister for the last time .
