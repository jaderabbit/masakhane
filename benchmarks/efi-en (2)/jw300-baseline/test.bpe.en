WH@@ A@@ T E@@ L@@ SE C@@ AN W@@ E L@@ E@@ AR@@ N F@@ R@@ O@@ M THE BIBLE ?

It com@@ forts people with the good news that God@@ ’@@ s heavenly Kingdom will soon end all wic@@ k@@ ed@@ ness and trans@@ form the earth into a paradise .
It prom@@ ot@@ es faith in Jesus Christ , who died so that we might gain everlasting life and who is now rul@@ ing as King of God@@ ’@@ s Kingdom .
This magazine has been published continu@@ ously since 18@@ 7@@ 9 and is n@@ on@@ poli@@ tical .
It ad@@ her@@ es to the Bible as its authority .
B@@ ebe had been very close to her father .
The rem@@ ar@@ k came from a well - meaning family friend , but B@@ ebe found it more c@@ ut@@ ting than com@@ for@@ ting .
“ His death w@@ as@@ n@@ ’@@ t for the best , ” she kept re@@ pe@@ ating to her@@ self .
It was clear that when B@@ ebe re@@ count@@ ed the inc@@ ident in a book years later , she was still gri@@ ev@@ ing .
As B@@ ebe came to see , it can take a long time for someone to over@@ come gri@@ ef , especially when the b@@ er@@ ea@@ ved person was very close to the dec@@ eas@@ ed .
In the Bible , death is ap@@ tly described as “ the last enem@@ y . ”
It bre@@ ak@@ s into our lives with ir@@ res@@ is@@ ti@@ b@@ le for@@ ce , often when we are complet@@ ely un@@ prepar@@ ed , and it r@@ ob@@ s us of those we hold d@@ ear .
N@@ one of us are imm@@ un@@ e to its ra@@ v@@ ages .
So it is not sur@@ pris@@ ing if we feel at a l@@ oss when it comes to cop@@ ing with death and its af@@ ter@@ m@@ ath .
Per@@ haps you have won@@ d@@ ered : ‘ How long does it take to get over gri@@ ef ?
How can I comfort others who have been b@@ er@@ ea@@ ved ?
Is there any hope for our loved ones who have died ? ’
Have you ever had a b@@ ri@@ ef b@@ out with ill@@ ness ?
As an example , consider how the p@@ at@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch Abraham re@@ acted when his wife died .
The Bible says that “ Abraham began to m@@ our@@ n and to we@@ ep over Sarah . ”
The ex@@ pression “ began to ” sugg@@ ests that it took some time for him to c@@ ope with his l@@ oss .
He gri@@ ev@@ ed for “ many days , ” and his family members were un@@ able to comfort him .
S@@ ever@@ al years later , the death of Joseph still w@@ ei@@ gh@@ ed hea@@ v@@ ily on his mind . ​ — Genesis 23 : 2 ; 37 : 34 , 35 ; 42 : 36 ; 45 : 28 .
“ My husband , R@@ ob@@ ert , died on Ju@@ ly 9 , 200@@ 8 .
S@@ i@@ x years later the pain in my heart is still there .
I d@@ on@@ ’@@ t think I will ever get over my l@@ oss of R@@ ob . ” ​ — G@@ ail , ag@@ ed 60 .
“ Although I have been without my d@@ ear wife for more than 18 years , I still mis@@ s her and gri@@ eve over my l@@ oss .
Wh@@ en@@ ever I see something in n@@ ature that is at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive , my thoughts go to her , and I cannot help wonder@@ ing how she would have enjoy@@ ed se@@ e@@ ing what I am se@@ e@@ ing . ” ​ — E@@ ti@@ en@@ ne , ag@@ ed 8@@ 4 .
C@@ lear@@ ly , such p@@ ain@@ ful and long - lasting feelings are only natur@@ al .
E@@ ach person gri@@ ev@@ es in his or her own way , and it would be un@@ wise to jud@@ ge the way another person respon@@ ds to tr@@ ag@@ ed@@ y .
At the same time , we may need to hold off from con@@ dem@@ ning ourselves if our re@@ action to l@@ oss se@@ ems exc@@ essi@@ ve .
As we no@@ te in the “ Im@@ it@@ ate Their F@@ a@@ ith ” article in this is@@ sue , Isaac was still gri@@ ev@@ ing over the l@@ oss of his mother , Sarah , three years after her death . ​ — Genesis 24 : 6@@ 7 .
For instance , you may find that some will adv@@ ise you not to cr@@ y or show your feelings in any way .
O@@ thers may p@@ us@@ h you to do the oppos@@ ite and ex@@ pose all your feelings .
The Bible pres@@ ents a more b@@ al@@ an@@ ced view , one that is supp@@ or@@ ted by mod@@ er@@ n res@@ earch .
In some cul@@ tures it is considered un@@ man@@ ly for a m@@ al@@ e to cr@@ y .
But is there a real need to feel ash@@ am@@ ed about sh@@ ed@@ ding t@@ ears , even in public ?
M@@ ental - health ex@@ per@@ ts ac@@ knowledge that t@@ ear@@ ful@@ ness is a nor@@ m@@ al part of gri@@ ev@@ ing .
And gri@@ ev@@ ing may , in time , help you to move on des@@ pite the en@@ or@@ m@@ ity of your l@@ oss .
At the death of his d@@ ear friend L@@ azar@@ us , Jesus op@@ en@@ ly w@@ ept , even though he had the power to bring the dead back to life ! ​ — John 11 : 33 - 35 .
B@@ ou@@ ts of anger are often part of gri@@ ev@@ ing , especially in c@@ as@@ es of s@@ ud@@ den , un@@ expec@@ ted death .
There are many reas@@ ons why a b@@ er@@ ea@@ ved person may feel ang@@ ry , such as when though@@ t@@ less and un@@ f@@ ound@@ ed comm@@ ents are made by a resp@@ ected person .
“ I was only 14 years old when my father died , ” expl@@ ains a S@@ outh Afri@@ can man named M@@ ike .
“ At the f@@ un@@ er@@ al , the An@@ g@@ li@@ can minis@@ ter said that God needs good people and t@@ akes them early .
* This ang@@ ered me because we des@@ per@@ ately needed our father .
E@@ spec@@ ially in the case of un@@ expec@@ ted death , the b@@ er@@ ea@@ ved person may re@@ pe@@ at@@ edly think , ‘ It might not have happened if only I had done this or that . ’
If you are being pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed by such feelings of gu@@ il@@ t and anger , it is important not to b@@ ot@@ tle up these em@@ o@@ tions .
Rather , speak to a friend who will listen and re@@ ass@@ ure you that such ir@@ r@@ ational feelings are common to many b@@ er@@ ea@@ ved ones .
The Bible rem@@ in@@ ds us : “ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of distr@@ ess . ” ​ — Proverbs 17 : 17 .
The best F@@ ri@@ end a b@@ er@@ ea@@ ved person can have is our Creator , Jehovah God .
P@@ our out your heart to him in prayer because “ he car@@ es for you . ”
Mor@@ e@@ over , he promises that all who do so will have their thoughts and feelings so@@ oth@@ ed by “ the peace of God that sur@@ pass@@ es all understanding . ”
Al@@ so , allow God to help you he@@ al by means of his cons@@ ol@@ ing Word , the Bible .
H@@ a@@ ving such thoughts to p@@ on@@ der over may be especially help@@ ful at night when you are alone and find it hard to s@@ le@@ ep . ​ — Isaiah 5@@ 7 : 15 .
R@@ ec@@ ently , a 40 - year - old man , whom we will call J@@ ack , lost his bel@@ ov@@ ed wife to can@@ c@@ er .
“ When I pray to Jehovah , ” he expl@@ ains , “ I never feel alone .
I often w@@ ake up during the night and cannot get back to s@@ le@@ ep .
After reading and m@@ edit@@ ating on com@@ for@@ ting thoughts from the Scriptures and then p@@ our@@ ing out the feelings of my heart in prayer , I sense a cal@@ m@@ ness and a trans@@ c@@ ending peace come over me , put@@ ting my mind and heart at rest and en@@ ab@@ ling me to s@@ le@@ ep . ”
A young woman named V@@ an@@ ess@@ a lost her mother to ill@@ ness .
She too has experienced the power of prayer .
“ In my most difficult times , ” she says , “ I would just call on God@@ ’@@ s name and bre@@ ak down in t@@ ears .
Jehovah list@@ ened to my prayers and always gave me the strength I needed . ”
Some b@@ er@@ ea@@ v@@ ement couns@@ el@@ ors adv@@ ise those who are str@@ ug@@ gl@@ ing with gri@@ ef to get involved in helping others or to v@@ olu@@ nt@@ e@@ er their time in some comm@@ unity service .
Do@@ ing so can bring joy and may eas@@ e a person@@ ’@@ s gri@@ ef .
Many b@@ er@@ ea@@ ved Christians have found that working to help others has brought them great comfort . ​ — 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 .
God fe@@ els for you in your pain . ​ — Psalm 55 : 22 ; 1 Peter 5 : 7 .
God pati@@ ently list@@ ens to the prayers of his servants . ​ — Psalm 8@@ 6 : 5 ; 1 Thessalon@@ ians 5 : 17 .
God mis@@ s@@ es people who have died . ​ — Job 14 : 13 - 15 .
God promises to resurrec@@ t the dead . ​ — Isaiah 26 : 19 ; John 5 : 28 , 29 .
Have you ever felt hel@@ pl@@ ess when someone near to you was gri@@ ev@@ ing over the l@@ oss of a loved one ?
S@@ om@@ etimes we may feel un@@ sure of what to say or do ​ — so we w@@ ind up saying and doing nothing .
But there are prac@@ tical , help@@ ful things that we can do .
Of@@ ten , all that is needed is your pres@@ ence along with a sim@@ ple ex@@ pression , such as “ I am so s@@ or@@ ry . ”
In many cul@@ tures , giving the person a hu@@ g or a g@@ ent@@ le s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze of the ar@@ m is an effec@@ tive way to show you care .
If the b@@ er@@ ea@@ ved one wants to talk , listen sy@@ m@@ p@@ a@@ the@@ tic@@ ally .
B@@ est of all , do something for the b@@ er@@ ea@@ ved family , perhaps per@@ form@@ ing a ch@@ ore the gri@@ ev@@ ing one has not been able to care for , such as co@@ ok@@ ing a me@@ al , car@@ ing for the children , or helping with f@@ un@@ er@@ al arrang@@ ements if that is desi@@ red .
Such actions may speak l@@ ou@@ der than the most el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent words .
In time , you may be moved to talk about the dec@@ eas@@ ed , perhaps fo@@ cus@@ ing on some good qualities or happy experi@@ ences .
Such con@@ vers@@ ation may even bring a s@@ mi@@ le to the b@@ er@@ ea@@ ved person@@ ’@@ s face .
For example , P@@ am ​ — who lost her husband , I@@ an , si@@ x years ago — ​ says : “ People som@@ etimes tell me good things that I@@ an did that I never knew about , and that makes my heart feel good . ”
R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers repor@@ t that many b@@ er@@ ea@@ ved people receive a l@@ ot of in@@ iti@@ al help but that their needs are soon for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten as friends get bus@@ y again with their own lives .
Therefore , make a point of cont@@ ac@@ ting a b@@ er@@ ea@@ ved friend on a reg@@ ular bas@@ is after the l@@ oss .
* Many gri@@ ev@@ ing ones deep@@ ly appreci@@ ate this opportunity to reli@@ eve themselves of pr@@ ol@@ ong@@ ed feelings of gri@@ ef .
Consider the example of K@@ a@@ ori , a young J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese woman who was dev@@ ast@@ ated by the l@@ oss of her mother follow@@ ed by the l@@ oss of her older sister 15 months later .
Th@@ an@@ k@@ fully , she received on@@ going support from loyal friends .
One named R@@ it@@ s@@ uko is much older than K@@ a@@ ori and offered to be her close friend .
“ To be hon@@ est , ” says K@@ a@@ ori , “ I w@@ as@@ n@@ ’@@ t happy about that .
I di@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t want anyone to take the place of my mother , and I di@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t think that anyone could .
However , because of the way M@@ ama R@@ it@@ s@@ uko tre@@ ated me , I came to feel close to her .
E@@ very we@@ ek , we went out in the ev@@ ang@@ eli@@ zing work together and went to Christian meetings together .
She inv@@ ited me to have te@@ a with her , brought me me@@ als , and wrote me let@@ ters and car@@ ds many times .
M@@ ama R@@ it@@ s@@ uk@@ o@@ ’@@ s positi@@ ve attitude had a good influence on me . ”
T@@ w@@ el@@ ve years have pass@@ ed since K@@ a@@ ori@@ ’@@ s mother died , and today she and her husband are full - time ev@@ ang@@ eli@@ z@@ ers .
“ M@@ ama R@@ it@@ s@@ uko , ” K@@ a@@ ori says , “ continu@@ es to show her concer@@ n .
When I go back home , I always vis@@ it her and enjoy her up@@ building associ@@ ation . ”
An@@ other example of someone who benef@@ ited from on@@ going support is P@@ ol@@ i , one of Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses in C@@ y@@ pr@@ us .
P@@ ol@@ i had a kind husband , S@@ o@@ z@@ os , who set a good example as a Christian shepher@@ d by often inv@@ iting or@@ ph@@ ans and wid@@ ow@@ s to their home for associ@@ ation and a me@@ al .
S@@ ad@@ ly , at the age of 5@@ 3 , S@@ o@@ z@@ os died of a b@@ ra@@ in tu@@ m@@ or .
There , they began associ@@ ating with a congregation of Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
“ The friends in my new congregation , ” rec@@ alls P@@ ol@@ i , “ did not know anything about our past and our difficult circumstances .
But that did not st@@ op them from appro@@ aching us and em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing us with their kind words and prac@@ tical help .
How preci@@ ous that help was , especially at that time , when my son needed his father most !
Those taking the lead in the congregation showed a great de@@ al of personal interest in Daniel .
One in par@@ tic@@ ular made sure to incl@@ ude Daniel when enjoy@@ ing associ@@ ation with friends or when going out to pl@@ ay b@@ all . ”
B@@ oth mother and son are doing well today .
To be sure , there are many ways we can offer prac@@ tical help and comfort to those who m@@ our@@ n .
The Bible also com@@ forts us by means of a thr@@ ill@@ ing hope for the future .
Some have even mar@@ ked the d@@ ate of the death on their cal@@ end@@ ar as a rem@@ ind@@ er to offer comfort when it may be most needed ​ — on or near the d@@ ate of the l@@ oss .
You may rec@@ all that G@@ ail , mentioned ear@@ lier in this seri@@ es , doub@@ ts whether she will ever get over the death of her husband , R@@ ob .
However , she is look@@ ing for@@ ward to se@@ e@@ ing him again in God@@ ’@@ s promised new world .
My feelings really go out to people who have lost someone they love but who are not aw@@ are of this hope of se@@ e@@ ing their loved one again . ”
S@@ oon , God will do just that ​ — for Job and count@@ less others — ​ when this earth is trans@@ formed into a paradise .
“ There is going to be a resurrection , ” the Bible con@@ fir@@ ms at Acts 24 : 15 .
“ Do not be am@@ a@@ zed at this , ” Jesus as@@ su@@ res us , “ for the hour is coming in which all those in the m@@ em@@ ori@@ al to@@ mb@@ s will hear his vo@@ ice and come out . ”
He will have the pr@@ osp@@ ect of reg@@ aining “ his y@@ ou@@ th@@ ful vi@@ g@@ or , ” and his flesh will forever remain “ fr@@ es@@ her than in y@@ outh . ”
The same will happ@@ en to all who respond with appreciation to God@@ ’@@ s mer@@ ci@@ ful prov@@ ision of a resurrection to life on earth .
If you have suf@@ fered the l@@ oss of someone d@@ ear to you , the information we have discus@@ sed may not complet@@ ely take away your gri@@ ef .
But by m@@ edit@@ ating on God@@ ’@@ s promises found in the Bible , you can find real hope and the strength to keep going . ​ — 1 Thessalon@@ ians 4 : 13 .
W@@ ould you like to learn more about how to c@@ ope with gri@@ ef ?
O@@ r do you have rel@@ ated questions , such as “ Why does God allow evil and suffering ? ”
P@@ le@@ ase vis@@ it our w@@ eb@@ si@@ te , j@@ w@@ .@@ or@@ g , to see how the Bible gives com@@ for@@ ting , prac@@ tical answers .
“ God . . . will wi@@ pe out every t@@ ear from their eyes , and death will be no more . ” ​ — Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 .
This is@@ sue of The Watchtower discus@@ s@@ es how God will ful@@ f@@ ill that promise and what it can mean for you .
C@@ O@@ V@@ ER S@@ U@@ B@@ JE@@ C@@ T | WH@@ Y DI@@ D J@@ ES@@ U@@ S S@@ U@@ F@@ F@@ ER AN@@ D DI@@ E ?
In the s@@ pr@@ ing of 33 C@@ .@@ E . , Jesus the N@@ azar@@ ene was ex@@ ec@@ uted .
He had been fal@@ sel@@ y char@@ ged with s@@ edi@@ tion , s@@ av@@ ag@@ ely be@@ at@@ en , and n@@ ail@@ ed to a st@@ ake .
But God ra@@ ised him back to life , and 40 days later , Jesus as@@ c@@ ended to heaven .
This ex@@ tr@@ a@@ ord@@ in@@ ary account comes to us from the four G@@ osp@@ els of the Christian Greek Scriptures , comm@@ only called the New T@@ est@@ am@@ ent .
On the other hand , if those events really did happ@@ en , then there is a b@@ right future for mankind , one in which you can share .
So , are the Gospel ac@@ count@@ s fact or fi@@ c@@ tion ?
Un@@ like f@@ anci@@ ful le@@ gen@@ ds , the Gospel writ@@ ings refl@@ ect p@@ ain@@ st@@ aking accur@@ ac@@ y and attention to det@@ ail .
For example , they ab@@ ound with n@@ ames of real plac@@ es , many of which can be vis@@ ited today .
They tell about real people , whose ex@@ ist@@ ence has been cor@@ r@@ ob@@ or@@ ated by sec@@ ular hist@@ or@@ ians . ​ — Luke 3 : 1 , 2 , 23 .
Jesus himself is mentioned by sec@@ ular writ@@ ers of the first and second centur@@ ies .
* His man@@ ner of death , as described in the G@@ osp@@ els , ag@@ re@@ es with Roman ex@@ ec@@ uti@@ onal me@@ th@@ od@@ s of the time .
Mor@@ e@@ over , events are rel@@ ated in a fac@@ t@@ ual and can@@ did man@@ ner ​ — even por@@ tr@@ aying some of Jesus ’ disciples un@@ fav@@ or@@ ably .
All these fac@@ t@@ ors str@@ ong@@ ly indic@@ ate that the Gospel writ@@ ers were hon@@ est and accur@@ ate in what they wrote about Jesus .
While it is gener@@ ally accepted that Jesus lived and died , some would question his resurrection .
Even his apostles did not believe the in@@ iti@@ al repor@@ t of his having re@@ turned to life .
All doubt was rem@@ ov@@ ed , however , when they and other disciples saw the resurrec@@ ted Jesus on s@@ ep@@ ar@@ ate occasi@@ ons .
In fact , in one case , there were more than 5@@ 00 ey@@ ew@@ it@@ nesses present . ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 6 .
At the ris@@ k of being ar@@ res@@ ted and k@@ ill@@ ed , the disciples courag@@ e@@ ously pro@@ claim@@ ed Jesus ’ resurrection to all ​ — even to the very ones who had ex@@ ec@@ uted him .
W@@ ould so many disciples have been so bo@@ ld if they were not ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely sure that Jesus had really been resurrec@@ ted ?
In fact , the re@@ ality of the resurrection of Jesus is the d@@ ri@@ ving for@@ ce beh@@ ind the imp@@ act that Christi@@ an@@ ity has had on the world both then and now .
The Gospel ac@@ count@@ s of Jesus ’ death and resurrection b@@ ear all the necess@@ ary mar@@ ks of an au@@ th@@ enti@@ c hist@@ or@@ ical rec@@ ord .
Car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly reading them will conv@@ in@@ ce you that these events really happened .
Your con@@ vic@@ tion can be fur@@ ther streng@@ th@@ ened when you understand why they took place .
T@@ ac@@ itus , born about 55 C@@ .@@ E . , wrote that “ Christ@@ us , from whom the name [ Christians ] had its ori@@ g@@ in , suf@@ fered the ex@@ tr@@ eme p@@ en@@ al@@ ty during the re@@ i@@ gn of T@@ ib@@ eri@@ us at the hands of one of our proc@@ ur@@ at@@ ors , P@@ on@@ ti@@ us P@@ il@@ at@@ us . ”
Jesus is also refer@@ red to by Su@@ et@@ oni@@ us ( first century ) ; Jewish hist@@ ori@@ an Josep@@ h@@ us ( first century ) ; and P@@ l@@ in@@ y the Y@@ oun@@ ger , gover@@ nor of B@@ i@@ th@@ y@@ n@@ ia ( early second century ) .
Then , too , it is un@@ likely that Jesus ’ many oppos@@ ers would w@@ ri@@ te anything that would l@@ end cre@@ di@@ b@@ ility to the repor@@ ts about him .
R@@ eg@@ arding Jesus ’ resurrection , Peter , one of his apostles , explained : “ God ra@@ ised this one up on the th@@ ir@@ d day and allow@@ ed him to become man@@ if@@ est , not to all the people , but to wit@@ nesses appointed b@@ ef@@ or@@ eh@@ and by God , to us , who ate and dr@@ an@@ k with him after his ris@@ ing from the dead . ”
Matthe@@ w@@ ’@@ s Gospel tell@@ s us that when the religious enem@@ ies heard repor@@ ts of Jesus ’ resurrection , they s@@ ch@@ em@@ ed to su@@ p@@ pr@@ ess them . ​ — Matthew 28 : 11 - 15 .
Does this mean that Jesus wanted his resurrection to be kept sec@@ re@@ t ?
No , for Peter went on to say : “ He ord@@ ered us to preach to the people and to give a thor@@ ough witness that this is the one dec@@ re@@ ed by God to be jud@@ ge of the living and the dead . ”
True Christians have done and are doing just that . ​ — Acts 10 : 42 .
“ Th@@ r@@ ough one man [ Adam ] sin ent@@ ered into the world and death through sin . ” ​ — Romans 5 : 12
What would you say if you were asked , “ Do you want to live forever ? ”
M@@ ost people would prob@@ ably say that they want to but that they feel it is un@@ re@@ al@@ is@@ tic to consider it .
De@@ ath is a nor@@ m@@ al part of life , they say , the natur@@ al out@@ come of our ex@@ ist@@ ence .
Su@@ pp@@ ose , though , that the question were turned around and you were asked , “ Are you ready to die ? ”
U@@ nd@@ er nor@@ m@@ al circumstances , most people would answer no .
The Bible shows that God cre@@ ated humans with the desire and the will to live .
In fact , it says that “ he has even put et@@ ern@@ ity in their heart . ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 3 : 11 .
The re@@ ality , though , is that humans do not live forever .
F@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , has God done anything to rem@@ ed@@ y the situation ?
The Bib@@ le@@ ’@@ s answers are heart@@ ening , and they have a direc@@ t b@@ earing on why Jesus suf@@ fered and died .
The first three chap@@ ters of the Bible book of Genesis tell us that God set before the first human couple , Adam and Eve , the pr@@ osp@@ ect of un@@ ending life and told them what they would have to do to gain it .
Then the account describ@@ es how they fail@@ ed to obey God and lost that pr@@ osp@@ ect .
The st@@ ory is told simply ​ — so simply that some are qu@@ ic@@ k to dis@@ mis@@ s it as fol@@ k@@ l@@ ore .
But Genesis , like the G@@ osp@@ els , gives every indic@@ ation of being a fac@@ t@@ ual , hist@@ or@@ ical rec@@ ord .
What has been the result of Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s fail@@ ure to obey ?
The Bible answers this way : “ Th@@ r@@ ough one man [ Adam ] sin ent@@ ered into the world and death through sin , and so death sp@@ read to all men because they had all sin@@ ned . ”
He thus lost the pr@@ osp@@ ect of end@@ less life and ev@@ entually died .
Be@@ ing his des@@ c@@ end@@ ants , we have in@@ her@@ ited his sin@@ ful con@@ dition .
But has God done anything to rem@@ ed@@ y the situation ?
Yes , God made arrang@@ ements to re@@ de@@ em , or bu@@ y back , what Adam had lost for his des@@ c@@ end@@ ants , nam@@ ely , the pr@@ osp@@ ect of end@@ less life .
“ The w@@ ages sin p@@ ays is death , ” says the Bible at Romans 6 : 23 .
This means that death is the con@@ sequ@@ ence of sin .
L@@ ik@@ ew@@ ise , we sin and are therefore sub@@ ject to sin@@ ’@@ s w@@ ages , death .
But we were born in this sin@@ ful con@@ dition through no fa@@ ul@@ t of our own .
So God lov@@ ingly sent his Son , Jesus , to accept ‘ the w@@ ages of sin ’ for us .
Jesus ’ death op@@ ens the way to a happy , end@@ less life
Since one man , the perfect man Adam , brought sin and death on us through dis@@ obedi@@ ence , a perfect man obedi@@ ent even till death was needed to re@@ le@@ ase us from that bur@@ den .
The Bible expl@@ ains it this way : “ Just as through the dis@@ obedi@@ ence of the one man many were made sin@@ n@@ ers , so also through the obedi@@ ence of the one person many will be made righteous . ”
He left heaven , became a perfect man * , and died in our beh@@ alf .
As a result , it is possible for us to have a righteous standing with God and gain the pr@@ osp@@ ect of end@@ less life .
Why , though , was it necess@@ ary for Jesus to die to accompl@@ ish this ?
C@@ ould not Al@@ mi@@ ghty God have simply is@@ su@@ ed a dec@@ ree that Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s des@@ c@@ end@@ ants be allow@@ ed to live forever ?
H@@ ad God set justice asi@@ de in this instance , people might have won@@ d@@ ered whether he would do so in other matters as well .
For example , would he be fai@@ r in determin@@ ing who among Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s off@@ s@@ pr@@ ing qual@@ if@@ y for et@@ ern@@ al life ?
C@@ ould he be tr@@ us@@ ted to keep his promises ?
God@@ ’@@ s ad@@ her@@ ence to justice in working out our sal@@ vation is ass@@ urance to us that he will always do what is right .
By Jesus ’ sacrifi@@ cial death , God op@@ ened the way to end@@ less life in Paradise on earth .
No@@ te Jesus ’ words as recorded at John 3 : 16 : “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - beg@@ ot@@ ten Son , so that every@@ one exerc@@ ising faith in him might not be destr@@ oy@@ ed but have everlasting life . ”
Jesus ’ death is thus an ex@@ pression not only of God@@ ’@@ s un@@ fail@@ ing justice but , more spec@@ ially , of his great love for humans .
However , why did Jesus have to suf@@ fer and die in the p@@ ain@@ ful way that was described in the G@@ osp@@ els ?
By sub@@ jec@@ ting himself to the ex@@ tr@@ eme t@@ est and rem@@ aining faithful , Jesus re@@ fut@@ ed once and for all the D@@ ev@@ il@@ ’@@ s cl@@ aim that humans would not remain loyal to God when under tri@@ al .
That cl@@ aim might have se@@ em@@ ed v@@ ali@@ d after Satan ind@@ uc@@ ed perfect Adam to sin .
But Jesus ​ — who was Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s perfect equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent — ​ rem@@ ained obedi@@ ent des@@ pite s@@ ev@@ ere suffering .
He thus proved that Adam too could have ob@@ ey@@ ed God if he had cho@@ s@@ en to do so .
By end@@ uring under tri@@ al , Jesus left us a mod@@ el to follow .
God re@@ war@@ ded his S@@ on@@ ’@@ s perfect obedi@@ ence , gr@@ an@@ ting Jesus immor@@ t@@ al life in heaven .
Jesus indic@@ ated what we need to do when he said : “ This means everlasting life , their coming to know you , the only true God , and the one whom you sent , Jesus Christ . ” ​ — John 17 : 3 .

We went to the ter@@ rit@@ ory , and he gave me some book@@ let@@ s about God@@ ’@@ s Kingdom .
One of the sisters there gave us children Bible less@@ ons based on the Bible and the book The H@@ ar@@ p of God .
As a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er , I enjoy@@ ed giving people hope from God@@ ’@@ s Word .

He said : “ Who gave you authority to jud@@ ge who is a go@@ at ?
L@@ et@@ ’@@ s just be happy giving people the good news and leave the judg@@ ing to Jehovah . ”
An@@ other older brother taught me that to find happiness in giving , we som@@ etimes have to end@@ ure pati@@ ently .
Y@@ ears later , his pati@@ ence was re@@ war@@ ded when his wife was baptized as one of Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
After the war , I pione@@ ered for two years in sou@@ ther@@ n I@@ rel@@ and .

So I said to my@@ self , ‘ R@@ on@@ al@@ d , if you want this gi@@ r@@ l , y@@ ou@@ ’@@ ve got to act qu@@ ick@@ ly . ’
After three we@@ ek@@ s I prop@@ os@@ ed , and after si@@ x we@@ ek@@ s we were married .
M@@ a@@ x@@ ine and I were assi@@ gned as mission@@ aries to P@@ u@@ er@@ to R@@ ic@@ o , so I never went out on the new bo@@ at .
For example , in the v@@ ill@@ age of P@@ ot@@ al@@ a P@@ as@@ til@@ l@@ o , there were two Witness famil@@ ies with many children , and I used to pl@@ ay the flu@@ te for them .
I asked one of the little gi@@ r@@ l@@ s , H@@ il@@ da , if she wanted to come and preach with us .
We b@@ ought her a p@@ ai@@ r , and she came preaching with us .
She was about to leave for her assignment in Ec@@ u@@ ad@@ or , and she said : “ You d@@ on@@ ’@@ t recogni@@ ze me , do you ?
I am the little gi@@ r@@ l from P@@ as@@ til@@ l@@ o who had no sho@@ es . ”
At first , L@@ enn@@ ar@@ t Joh@@ ns@@ on and I did most of the work .
Na@@ than K@@ nor@@ r , who was then taking the lead among Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , came to P@@ u@@ er@@ to R@@ ic@@ o .
L@@ ater , he gave me strong counsel about being organi@@ zed and said that he was dis@@ appointed in me .
Father did not accept the truth when M@@ other and I did .
My d@@ ear wife , M@@ a@@ x@@ ine , died in 20@@ 11 .
I am really look@@ ing for@@ ward to se@@ e@@ ing her again in the resurrection .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing we do at Bethel is sac@@ red service .

After reading the article ‘ Do You Have “ a H@@ ear@@ t to K@@ now ” Jehovah ? ’
in The Watchtower of Mar@@ ch 15 , 20@@ 13 , I really felt that Jehovah does want to help me . ”
( a ) How did Paul feel about his str@@ ug@@ gl@@ es ?
What can we learn about clo@@ thing from God@@ ’@@ s Law to the Israelites ?
What can help Christians to make good decisions about how to dr@@ ess ?
When especially do we need to w@@ ear appro@@ pri@@ ate clo@@ thing ?
Of course , some clo@@ thing that is appro@@ pri@@ ate in one place may not be appro@@ pri@@ ate in another .
( Read 1 Corinthians 10 : 32 , 33 . )
What are some fac@@ t@@ ors that may af@@ fect whether a brother w@@ ears a b@@ ear@@ d ?
The Mos@@ ai@@ c Law requir@@ ed men to w@@ ear a b@@ ear@@ d .
What effect should our dr@@ ess and gr@@ o@@ om@@ ing have on others ?
A brother in Germany wrote : “ My teach@@ ers view the Bible account of cre@@ ation as a my@@ th .
And they take it for gr@@ anted that the students believe in ev@@ ol@@ ution . ”
A young sister in Fr@@ ance said : “ T@@ e@@ ach@@ ers in my school are qu@@ ite ast@@ on@@ ished that there are students who still believe in the Bible . ”
and The O@@ ri@@ g@@ in of Life ​ — F@@ ive Qu@@ es@@ tions Wor@@ th As@@ king , and the book Is There a Creator Who Car@@ es Ab@@ out You ?

Why does God want you to use your power of reason ?
( Read Romans 12 : 1 , 2 ; 1 Timothy 2 : 4 . )
And many of them lived at different times and did not know one another person@@ ally . ”
I liter@@ ally had to st@@ op and cont@@ em@@ pl@@ ate how in@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ le that proph@@ eti@@ c P@@ ass@@ over me@@ al was ! ”
“ H@@ on@@ es@@ ty like that is r@@ are , ” said a young brother in B@@ rit@@ ain .
“ This ad@@ ds to our confidence that the Bible truly is from Jehovah . ”
And some st@@ op believ@@ ing in God because they are dis@@ appointed with religion .
He ad@@ ded : “ One is struc@@ k by the compl@@ ex@@ ity of even the sim@@ pl@@ est form of life . ”
He wrote : “ E@@ very house is con@@ struc@@ ted by someone , but the one who con@@ struc@@ ted all things is God . ”
Why is it so important to know your children well ?
Our children ac@@ qu@@ i@@ re it little by little . ”
He as@@ ks : ‘ What does the Bible say ? ’
‘ Do you believe what it says ? ’
He wants me to answer in my own words and not simply re@@ pe@@ at his or M@@ um@@ ’@@ s words .
As I got older , I had to exp@@ and on my answers . ”
They answ@@ ered all my questions , using the Bible . ”
( Read Deuteronomy 6 : 5 - 8 ; Luke 6 : 45 . )
So if life ev@@ ol@@ ved from sim@@ ple to more compl@@ e@@ x form@@ s , why were these ancient cre@@ at@@ ures already so compl@@ e@@ x ?
It was a less@@ on that deep@@ ly im@@ pr@@ essed me and that I shar@@ ed with my son . ”
Then she asked each of the b@@ oy@@ s to make her a c@@ up of c@@ of@@ fe@@ e .
“ They took great care , ” she explained .
“ When I asked them why they were so car@@ eful , they said that they wanted the c@@ of@@ fe@@ e to be just the way I like it .
I explained that God mi@@ x@@ ed the g@@ as@@ es in the at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ ere with similar care ​ — just right for us . ”
And how would you comp@@ are the s@@ ound of an ai@@ r@@ pl@@ an@@ e to the sing@@ ing of a bir@@ d ?
So who is more int@@ el@@ lig@@ ent ​ — the m@@ ak@@ er of ai@@ r@@ pl@@ an@@ es or the Creator of bir@@ ds ? ”
“ N@@ ever ti@@ re of ex@@ per@@ im@@ ent@@ ing with new ways to appro@@ ach old sub@@ jec@@ ts , ” said one father .
“ From the time they were very young , I studi@@ ed with them for 15 min@@ ut@@ es every day , exc@@ ept on days when we had Christian meetings .
O@@ ver time , many of these were ad@@ dr@@ essed at meetings or during family or personal study .
Th@@ at@@ ’@@ s why it@@ ’@@ s important for parents just to keep teaching . ”
Let your children see how real Jehovah is to you .
“ We also tell our older daugh@@ ter , ‘ Have complete trust in Jehovah , keep bus@@ y in Kingdom service , and do not wor@@ ry too much . ’
When she se@@ es the out@@ come , she know@@ s that Jehovah is helping us .
This has done won@@ ders for her faith in God and in the Bible . ”
The first article shows how our faith can gr@@ ow and remain strong .
Let me expl@@ ain what led to that con@@ vers@@ ation .
I W@@ A@@ S born in W@@ i@@ ch@@ ita , K@@ ans@@ as , U@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ A . , on Dec@@ ember 10 , 19@@ 36 , the ol@@ d@@ est of four children .
Then a sol@@ di@@ er wal@@ ked by , and the do@@ ct@@ or y@@ ell@@ ed , “ Do something about this y@@ el@@ low c@@ ow@@ ard ! ”
The sol@@ di@@ er could see that the man was dr@@ un@@ k , so he told him , “ G@@ o home and s@@ ob@@ er up ! ”
He ow@@ ned two b@@ ar@@ b@@ er@@ sho@@ ps in W@@ i@@ ch@@ ita , and the do@@ ct@@ or was one of his c@@ li@@ ents !
With my parents , going to a conven@@ tion in W@@ i@@ ch@@ ita in the 19@@ 40 ’ s
With Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s blessing and their z@@ eal@@ ous work , a congregation was started .
The brother also s@@ old my c@@ ar for $ 25 .
We were assi@@ gned to special pioneer in W@@ al@@ n@@ ut R@@ id@@ ge , Ar@@ k@@ ans@@ as .
Then in 19@@ 6@@ 2 , we were thr@@ ill@@ ed to receive an inv@@ it@@ ation to the 3@@ 7@@ th class of Gilead .
In the ministry in N@@ ai@@ r@@ ob@@ i with Mary and Chr@@ is K@@ an@@ ai@@ y@@ a
S@@ oon after , our first daugh@@ ter , K@@ i@@ mb@@ er@@ ly , was born , and 17 months later , we had St@@ eph@@ any .
We would also go cam@@ p@@ ing with them and would have very enjoy@@ able con@@ vers@@ ations around the cam@@ p@@ fi@@ re .
We arrang@@ ed to have some who were in the full - time ministry stay in our home .
With the help and direction of God@@ ’@@ s organization , we did our best to ra@@ ise them to love Jehovah .
On a later tri@@ p , K@@ i@@ mb@@ er@@ ly met one of his work@@ m@@ ates , B@@ ri@@ an L@@ l@@ ew@@ ell@@ y@@ n .
So they did stay free until they were at le@@ ast 23 .
At the same time , B@@ ri@@ an and K@@ i@@ mb@@ er@@ ly were inv@@ ited to work at L@@ on@@ don Bethel and later were trans@@ fer@@ red to Mal@@ aw@@ i Bethel .
The day after we left for the Watchtower Ed@@ uc@@ ational C@@ enter in P@@ at@@ ter@@ son , L@@ ind@@ a called to tell us that M@@ other had died .
N@@ ext , we taught the course in Z@@ i@@ mb@@ ab@@ we and then in Z@@ amb@@ ia .
In 200@@ 6 , B@@ ri@@ an and K@@ i@@ mb@@ er@@ ly moved next do@@ or to us to ra@@ ise their two daugh@@ ters , M@@ ack@@ en@@ z@@ ie and Eli@@ z@@ ab@@ eth .
Paul and St@@ eph@@ any are still in Mal@@ aw@@ i , where Paul ser@@ ves on the Br@@ an@@ ch Comm@@ it@@ te@@ e .
Why might we need to ad@@ just our view of str@@ ang@@ ers ?
When I left the ai@@ r@@ por@@ t and felt the co@@ ld for the first time in my life , I started cr@@ ying . ”
Greek - speaking Jews compl@@ ained that their wid@@ ow@@ s were not being tre@@ ated fai@@ r@@ ly .

Are you among those who are lear@@ ning another language ?
( Read Nehemiah 13 : 23 , 24 . )
( b ) How can we reach our go@@ al ?
We must recogni@@ ze that when we pre@@ p@@ are for the ministry , for the meetings , or for a talk , we may not necess@@ ar@@ ily apply what we read to ourselves .
Since my mind is main@@ ly involved in an int@@ ell@@ ec@@ t@@ ual exerc@@ ise , my heart is not necess@@ ar@@ ily t@@ ou@@ ched by the spiritual thoughts I am reading .
That is why I reg@@ ularly set asi@@ de time to study the Bible and other public@@ ations in my mother t@@ ong@@ ue . ”
“ It ann@@ oy@@ ed him to go out in the ministry in another language , wh@@ ere@@ as before he loved preaching in his n@@ ative language , Fr@@ en@@ ch , ” says M@@ ur@@ iel .
“ When we reali@@ zed that this situation had h@@ ind@@ ered our son from making spiritual adv@@ anc@@ ement , ” expl@@ ains Ser@@ ge , “ we dec@@ ided to move back to our form@@ er congregation . ”
M@@ ake sure that the truth re@@ ach@@ es the hearts of your children ( See par@@ ag@@ r@@ aph@@ s 14 , 15 )
But we also incl@@ ude prac@@ tice s@@ essi@@ ons and g@@ ames in L@@ ing@@ al@@ a so that they can learn this language while having f@@ u@@ n . ”
M@@ ake an effort to learn the local language and to par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate in the meetings ( See par@@ ag@@ r@@ aph@@ s 16 , 17 )

What tri@@ als did some of the proph@@ ets end@@ ure because of their faith ?
O@@ thers , like Elijah , “ w@@ and@@ ered about in des@@ er@@ ts and mount@@ ains and ca@@ ves and d@@ ens of the earth . ”
How does No@@ ah@@ ’@@ s example help us to understand what it means to have faith ?
In what ways must we exerc@@ ise our faith ?
In what two ways does Hebrews 11 : 1 describ@@ e faith ?
You see that his faith was ac@@ tive along with his works and his faith was per@@ fec@@ ted by his works . ”
For example , John explained : “ The one who exerc@@ ises faith in the Son has everlasting life ; the one who dis@@ ob@@ ey@@ s the Son will not see life , but the wr@@ ath of God rem@@ ains upon him . ”
C@@ om@@ par@@ ed with love , how important is faith ?
James asked his anointed brothers : “ Did not God cho@@ ose those who are po@@ or from the world@@ ’@@ s stand@@ point to be rich in faith and he@@ ir@@ s of the Kingdom , which he promised to those who love him ? ”
While men were s@@ le@@ ep@@ ing , his enem@@ y came and over@@ s@@ ow@@ ed we@@ eds in among the wh@@ eat and left .

What hope did Jehovah give his people , and why was this promise rem@@ ar@@ k@@ able ?
W@@ ould the Israelites ever again be able to worship God in a complet@@ ely accep@@ table way ?
So it does not really se@@ em that Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s people ent@@ ered into c@@ apti@@ v@@ ity to Babylon the Gre@@ at in 19@@ 18 .
( Read 1 Peter 2 : 9 , 10 . )
( Read Matthew 13 : 24 , 25 , 37 - 39 . )
W@@ ould true Christians ever be free to worship God op@@ en@@ ly and accep@@ t@@ ably ?
When were the anointed fre@@ ed from Babyl@@ oni@@ an c@@ apti@@ v@@ ity ?

He also rem@@ ind@@ ed me of Jesus ’ words ​ — that each of us is wor@@ th more than many sp@@ arr@@ ow@@ s .
I often rec@@ all that s@@ crip@@ ture , and it still t@@ ou@@ ches my heart .
What can we learn from the way Jehovah , Jesus , and Paul encourag@@ ed others ?
( Read Ecclesiastes 4 : 9 , 10 . )
What can we learn from the way Jesus tre@@ ated his apostles ?
After going through those re@@ gi@@ ons and giving many words of encourag@@ ement to the ones there , he arri@@ ved in Greece . ”

( Read Luke 21 : 1 - 4 ; 2 Corinthians 8 : 12 . )
( Read Revelation 2 : 18 , 19 . )
I want you to know that when you spoke in such a kind way , both from the pl@@ at@@ form and in person , I felt that it was a gift from Jehovah . ”

( b ) What will we discus@@ s in this article ?
How did the congregations benefit from following the direction of the gover@@ ning body ?
( Read 3 John 9 , 10 . )

What are some reas@@ ons why we should be than@@ k@@ ful to Jehovah ?
There are many reas@@ ons why we should be than@@ k@@ ful to Jehovah !
It also shows how the hope of a re@@ ward benef@@ its us .
I was only ei@@ ght years old at the time .
My father did not want my mother to talk to me about what she was lear@@ ning .
However , I was c@@ ur@@ i@@ ous and asked questions , so she studi@@ ed with me when my father was out of the house .
As a result , I too dec@@ ided that I wanted to dedic@@ ate my life to Jehovah .
My mother said that I should first speak to the serv@@ ant to the bre@@ thr@@ en ( now called a circuit overse@@ er ) .
After four months , I sel@@ ected a brother as my pioneer par@@ t@@ ner .
My mother pione@@ ered with a sister in another congregation .
In 195@@ 1 , I fill@@ ed out an app@@ lic@@ ation to att@@ end the Watchtower Bible S@@ cho@@ ol of Gilead .

How can you experience “ the peace of God ” ?
How can the congregation help you to re@@ du@@ ce anxi@@ ety ?
( See op@@ ening pic@@ ture . ) ( b ) What will we consider in this article ?
How , though , can you do that ?
The psalmist David beg@@ ged Jehovah : “ L@@ ist@@ en to my prayer , O God . ”
When we are anxi@@ ous , why is prayer so important ?
( Read Matthew 11 : 28 - 30 . )
What did Jesus mean when he said : “ N@@ ever be anxi@@ ous ” ?
He ad@@ m@@ itted : “ My angu@@ ished heart makes me gr@@ o@@ an al@@ ou@@ d . ”
( See the bo@@ x “ Some Pr@@ ac@@ tical W@@ ays to R@@ edu@@ ce An@@ xi@@ ety . ” )
How can the meaning of God@@ ’@@ s name streng@@ then your faith ?
His very name is under@@ stood to mean “ He C@@ a@@ uses to Bec@@ ome . ”
Why can you be conf@@ ident that your relationship with God will streng@@ then you ?
( a ) How can we thr@@ ow our anxi@@ ety on God ?
How can we be sure that Jehovah re@@ war@@ ds his servants ?
How did Jehovah bl@@ ess his servants in the past ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) How are love and faith con@@ nec@@ ted ?
How , though , does the hope of a re@@ ward benefit us ?
Jesus showed that his disciples would be re@@ war@@ ded for their sacrifi@@ ces ( See par@@ ag@@ r@@ ap@@ h 5 )
The apostle Peter once asked Jesus : “ We have left all things and follow@@ ed you ; what , then , will there be for us ? ”
In the Ser@@ m@@ on on the M@@ ount , Jesus said : “ Re@@ jo@@ ice and be over@@ joy@@ ed , since your re@@ ward is great in the heavens , for in that way they persec@@ uted the proph@@ ets pri@@ or to you . ”
Moses told the nation of Israel : “ Jehovah will su@@ rely bl@@ ess you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to poss@@ ess as an in@@ her@@ it@@ ance , but only if you str@@ ic@@ tly obey the vo@@ ice of Jehovah your God and car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly ob@@ serve all this command@@ ment that I am giving you today .
For Jehovah your God will bl@@ ess you just as he has promised you . ”
And he named the second one Eph@@ r@@ aim , for he said , ‘ God has made me fru@@ it@@ ful in the land of my af@@ f@@ lic@@ tion . ’ ”
God@@ ’@@ s Word expl@@ ains : “ For the joy that was set before him he end@@ ured a tor@@ ture st@@ ake , des@@ p@@ ising sh@@ ame . ”
Jesus certainly found joy in being able to s@@ anc@@ ti@@ fy God@@ ’@@ s name .
How does Jehovah feel about what we do for him ?
“ The one show@@ ing fav@@ or to the low@@ ly is l@@ ending to Jehovah , and He will rep@@ ay him for what he does . ”
What comfort do we find at 1 John 3 : 19 , 20 ?
( Read 1 John 3 : 19 , 20 . )
What are some of the re@@ war@@ ds that we enjoy now ?
How do Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s servants feel about the re@@ war@@ ds they receive ?
For example , B@@ i@@ an@@ ca from Germany says : “ I cannot than@@ k Jehovah en@@ ough for helping me with my wor@@ ri@@ es and for being at my side each day .
The world out there is cha@@ oti@@ c and b@@ le@@ ak .
But as I work clos@@ ely with Jehovah , I feel sec@@ ure in his ar@@ ms .
Wh@@ en@@ ever I make personal sacrifi@@ ces for him , he gives me back a h@@ und@@ re@@ d@@ fo@@ ld in blessings . ”
For my own encourag@@ ement , I keep a n@@ ot@@ eb@@ o@@ ok with s@@ crip@@ tures and thoughts from our public@@ ations that I can cons@@ ul@@ t from time to time .
I call it ‘ My S@@ ur@@ vi@@ v@@ al N@@ ot@@ eb@@ o@@ ok . ’
D@@ is@@ courag@@ ement is tem@@ por@@ ary if we fo@@ cus on Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s promises .
Jehovah is always there to help us , reg@@ ar@@ d@@ less of our circumstances . ”
Yet , you can likely think of ways in which Jehovah has re@@ war@@ ded you and those around you .
How were Paul and others set free from sin and death ?
( Read Romans 6 : 1 , 2 . )
What cho@@ ice does each of us have to make ?
( Read Proverbs 14 : 5 ; Ephesians 4 : 25 . )

11 , 12 . ( a ) After he sin@@ ned , what could David not do ?
What David could not do : David could not und@@ o what he had done .
He had to trust that when he truly rep@@ ented , Jehovah would for@@ give him and help him end@@ ure the con@@ sequ@@ ences of his actions .
He had to leave the matter in Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s hands .

The Ju@@ ly 15 , 20@@ 13 , is@@ sue of The Watchtower explained that “ the faithful and dis@@ cre@@ et slave ” is a small group of anointed brothers who make up the G@@ over@@ ning B@@ ody .
So how can we answer Jesus ’ question : “ Who really is the faithful and dis@@ cre@@ et slave ? ”
How has holy spirit helped the G@@ over@@ ning B@@ ody ?
What is one way to remember the G@@ over@@ ning B@@ ody ?

THE very first words of the Bible make this sim@@ ple but pr@@ of@@ ound stat@@ ement : “ In the begin@@ ning God cre@@ ated the heavens and the earth . ”
( c ) What questions will we consider ?
And why is Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice the k@@ ey that un@@ loc@@ ks the do@@ or for God@@ ’@@ s purpose to be accompl@@ ished ?
What are some gif@@ ts that Jehovah gave Adam and Eve ?
It was as if he were saying : ‘ You mean you cannot do what you want ? ’
But Jehovah is faithful to his own standards ; he never viol@@ ates them .
( Read Deuteronomy 32 : 4 , 5 . )
Why is the ransom such a preci@@ ous gift ?
Jehovah provided the ransom at great c@@ ost to himself .
When will Jehovah become “ all things to every@@ one ” ?
How can we show that we love Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s name ?
( Read 1 Peter 1 : 15 , 16 . )
Why can Jehovah view us as righteous , even though we are im@@ perfect ?
He accep@@ ts as his worshipp@@ ers those who dedic@@ ate themselves to him .
What did Jesus mean when he next said : “ Let your will take place ” ?
How does the ransom benefit humans who have died ?
What is God@@ ’@@ s will for the “ great crow@@ d ” ?
( a ) What blessings do we now receive from Jehovah ?
( Read Acts 3 : 19 - 21 . )
And should we at times change a decision that we have made ?
This article will help us to answer those questions .
Yet , Jehovah view@@ ed those k@@ ings as having a complete heart .
Will God view us as having a complete heart , des@@ pite m@@ ist@@ akes we make ?
We lived on a small f@@ ar@@ m in eas@@ tern S@@ outh D@@ ak@@ ot@@ a .
F@@ ar@@ m@@ ing was an important part of our famil@@ y@@ ’@@ s life , but it was not the most important part .
My parents got baptized as Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses in 19@@ 34 .
My d@@ ad , C@@ lar@@ ence , and later my un@@ c@@ le Al@@ fr@@ ed , served as comp@@ any serv@@ ant ( now called co@@ ord@@ in@@ at@@ or of the body of elders ) in our small congregation in Con@@ de , S@@ outh D@@ ak@@ ot@@ a .
My sister , D@@ or@@ othy , and I became Kingdom publish@@ ers when we were si@@ x .
Con@@ ven@@ tions and ass@@ emb@@ lies were an important part of our lives .
The Bible says : “ The one wal@@ king with the wise will become wise , ” and there were many wise ones in my family who supp@@ or@@ ted my decision to pioneer .
When they were serving congregations n@@ ear@@ by , they som@@ etimes inv@@ ited me to go with them in the ministry .
As a new Be@@ th@@ eli@@ te , with a f@@ ar@@ m tr@@ uc@@ k
The f@@ ar@@ m on St@@ at@@ en Is@@ land includ@@ ed the ra@@ di@@ o st@@ ation W@@ B@@ B@@ R .
On@@ ly 15 to 20 members of the Bethel family were assi@@ gned to the f@@ ar@@ m .
M@@ ost of us were young and qu@@ ite in@@ experienced .
Brother Pet@@ er@@ son did his work at Bethel well but never ne@@ gl@@ ected the field ministry .
With An@@ g@@ el@@ a in 19@@ 7@@ 5 , before a t@@ el@@ ev@@ ision inter@@ view
Th@@ ree years later , we were inv@@ ited to Bethel .
Why do Jehovah and Christ des@@ er@@ ve to be hon@@ or@@ ed ?
H@@ um@@ ans were cre@@ ated “ in God@@ ’@@ s im@@ age . ”
8 , 9 . ( a ) How do Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses view govern@@ ment offi@@ ci@@ als ?
( Read 1 Timothy 5 : 17 . )
N@@ ei@@ ther be called lead@@ ers , for your Le@@ ad@@ er is one , the Christ .
W@@ ho@@ ever ex@@ al@@ ts himself will be humb@@ led , and who@@ ever humb@@ les himself will be ex@@ al@@ ted . ”
Why should others not make decisions for us ?
( a ) To make wise decisions , we should have faith in what ?
What will help us to make wise decisions ?
( Read 2 Corinthians 1 : 24 . )
L@@ ov@@ ing elders help others learn to make their own decisions ( See par@@ ag@@ r@@ ap@@ h 11 )
El@@ ders too should take time to do res@@ earch .
Will it bring joy and peace to my family ?
And will it show that I am pati@@ ent and kind ? ’
Why does Jehovah exp@@ ect us to make our own decisions ?
What does it mean to serve Jehovah with a complete heart ?
Wh@@ i@@ ch of the four k@@ ings would you like to imitate , and why ?
( Read 2 Chronicles 14 : 11 . )
What would your heart move you to do ?
A@@ sa@@ ’@@ s son Jeho@@ s@@ ha@@ ph@@ at “ kept wal@@ king in the way of his father As@@ a . ”
( Read 2 Chronicles 20 : 2 - 4 . )
( Read Isaiah 37 : 15 - 20 . )
( Read 2 K@@ ings 20 : 1 - 3 . )
( Read 2 Chronicles 34 : 18 , 19 . )
Why will we consider the examples of four k@@ ings of Judah ?
( Read 2 Chronicles 16 : 7 - 9 . )
( Read 2 Chronicles 32 : 31 . )
( Read 2 Chronicles 35 : 20 - 22 . )
The Bible says that N@@ ec@@ ho@@ ’@@ s words were “ from the m@@ outh of God . ”
Let us medi@@ tate on these Bible ac@@ count@@ s and be than@@ k@@ ful that Jehovah has provided them for us !
What about your dedic@@ ation v@@ ow or your marriage v@@ ow ?
When we believe that we have person@@ ally experienced or ob@@ served an in@@ justice , our faith , hu@@ mil@@ ity , and loy@@ al@@ ty may be t@@ ested .
“ The world is pass@@ ing away and so is its desire , but the one who does the will of God rem@@ ains forever . ” ​ — 1 J@@ O@@ H@@ N 2 : 17 .
What will Jehovah do about wicked people and cor@@ rup@@ t organi@@ z@@ ations ?
The Bible says : “ The world is pass@@ ing away . ”
L@@ ater in the same psalm , we read : “ The righteous will poss@@ ess the earth , and they will live forever on it . ”
Who are “ the me@@ ek ” and “ the righteous ” ?
Why can we be sure that the new earth will be well - organi@@ zed ?
After Ar@@ mag@@ ed@@ don , will there be any organization on earth ?
So the “ new earth ” will be organi@@ zed .
What kind of wrong activities are common where you live , and how are you and your family affec@@ ted ?
What do we learn from Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s judgment of S@@ od@@ om and G@@ om@@ or@@ r@@ ah ?
( Read 2 Peter 2 : 6 - 8 . )
( Read Psalm 46 : 8 , 9 . )
What are some things that will be g@@ one forever after Ar@@ mag@@ ed@@ don ?
I@@ l@@ l@@ ustr@@ ate . ( b ) How can we be sure that we will remain after this old world is g@@ one ?
“ W@@ I@@ L@@ L the Jud@@ ge of all the earth not do what is right ? ”
Because Jehovah is the great@@ est example of justice and righteousness .
Christians exp@@ ect to experience some in@@ justice out@@ side the Christian congregation .
In 19@@ 46 , he att@@ ended the ei@@ gh@@ th class of Gilead S@@ cho@@ ol in New York , U@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ A .
After gr@@ adu@@ ation , he was ev@@ entually assi@@ gned to the circuit work in S@@ wit@@ z@@ er@@ land .
What examples will we consider in this article and in the next ?
In this article , we will consider Abra@@ h@@ am@@ ’@@ s great - gr@@ and@@ son Joseph and his experience with his brothers .
10 , 11 . ( a ) What in@@ jus@@ tic@@ es did Joseph experience ?
( Read Matthew 5 : 23 , 24 ; 18 : 15 . )
L@@ oy@@ al@@ ty to Jehovah and to our brothers will prot@@ ect us from making such a mis@@ take .
M@@ ost important , he did not allow the im@@ per@@ fec@@ tions and wrong actions of others to s@@ ep@@ ar@@ ate him from Jehovah .
Why should we draw even clos@@ er to Jehovah if we experience in@@ justice in the congregation ?
How can we show that we have confidence in “ the Jud@@ ge of all the earth ” ?
See W@@ ill@@ i Di@@ eh@@ l@@ ’@@ s life st@@ ory , “ Jehovah Is My God , in W@@ ho@@ m I Will Tr@@ ust , ” in the N@@ ov@@ ember 1 , 199@@ 1 , is@@ sue of The Watchtower .

What less@@ ons can we learn from Je@@ ph@@ th@@ ah and H@@ ann@@ ah ?
2 , 3 . ( a ) What is a v@@ ow ?
( b ) What do the Scriptures say about making v@@ ow@@ s to God ?
He should do everything he v@@ ow@@ ed he would do . ”
( a ) How serious is it to make a v@@ ow to God ?
( b ) What do we want to learn about Je@@ ph@@ th@@ ah and H@@ ann@@ ah ?
( a ) How eas@@ y was it for Je@@ ph@@ th@@ ah and his daugh@@ ter to p@@ ay his v@@ ow to God ?
Je@@ ph@@ th@@ ah said : “ I have op@@ ened my m@@ outh to Jehovah , and I am un@@ able to turn back . ”
( b ) What did H@@ ann@@ ah@@ ’@@ s v@@ ow mean for Samuel ?
She took Samuel to H@@ i@@ gh P@@ ri@@ est El@@ i at the t@@ ab@@ ern@@ ac@@ le in S@@ hil@@ oh and said : “ It was for this bo@@ y that I pray@@ ed , and Jehovah gr@@ anted my pe@@ ti@@ tion that I asked of him .
The second most important v@@ ow that a person can make is the marriage v@@ ow .
What does the Bible say about div@@ or@@ ce and s@@ ep@@ ar@@ ation ?
( Read 1 Corinthians 7 : 10 , 11 . )
One couple said : “ Since we have been stud@@ ying this br@@ o@@ ch@@ ure , our marriage has been happ@@ i@@ er than ever . ”
We are doing much better now as a couple . ”
18 , 19 . ( a ) What have many Christian parents done ?
( b ) What can be said about those who are in special full - time service ?
S@@ pec@@ ial full - time service v@@ ow ( See par@@ ag@@ r@@ ap@@ h 19 )
It is not the people but their assign@@ ments that are view@@ ed as special .
See the A@@ pp@@ en@@ di@@ x article “ The Bib@@ le@@ ʼ@@ s V@@ i@@ ew on Di@@ v@@ or@@ ce and Sep@@ ar@@ ation ” in the book “ K@@ eep Y@@ ourselves in God@@ ʼ@@ s L@@ ove . ”
Does the Al@@ mi@@ ghty care that you are righteous , or does he gain anything because you follow the course of integrity ? ”
( b ) How did Israel def@@ eat J@@ ab@@ in@@ ’@@ s ar@@ my ?
( Read Jud@@ ges 4 : 14 - 16 . )
The tor@@ r@@ ent of K@@ ish@@ on w@@ ash@@ ed them away . ”
See the article “ An@@ xi@@ ety Ab@@ out M@@ on@@ ey ” in the Ju@@ ly 1 , 20@@ 15 , is@@ sue of The Watchtower .
1 , 2 . ( a ) What in@@ justice did N@@ ab@@ oth and his sons experience ?
( b ) What two qualities will we consider in this article ?
What kind of man was N@@ ab@@ oth , and why did he ref@@ use to sel@@ l his v@@ in@@ ey@@ ard to King A@@ ha@@ b ?
N@@ ab@@ oth was faithful to Jehovah at a time when most Israelites were following the bad example of King A@@ ha@@ b and his wife , wicked Qu@@ e@@ en Je@@ z@@ eb@@ el .
Read 1 K@@ ings 21 : 1 - 3 .
He resp@@ ec@@ t@@ fully explained : “ It is un@@ thin@@ k@@ able , from Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s stand@@ point , for me to give you the in@@ her@@ it@@ ance of my for@@ ef@@ ath@@ ers . ”
Why would hu@@ mil@@ ity have been a protec@@ tion to N@@ ab@@ oth@@ ’@@ s family and friends ?
( Read Deuteronomy 32 : 3 , 4 . )
( b ) In what ways will hu@@ mil@@ ity prot@@ ect us ?
How will you respond if the elders ann@@ oun@@ ce a decision that you do not ag@@ ree with ?
What account will we now consider , and why ?
How was Peter cor@@ rec@@ ted , and what questions ar@@ ise ?
In fact , he was later inspired to w@@ ri@@ te two let@@ ters that became part of the Bible .
3 H@@ el@@ p@@ ing “ F@@ or@@ ei@@ gn R@@ esid@@ ents ” to “ Ser@@ ve Jehovah With Re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing ”
The second article consid@@ ers how ap@@ pl@@ ying Bible principles will help imm@@ i@@ gr@@ ant parents to make decisions that will benefit their children .
“ We could see people r@@ un@@ ning , sho@@ ot@@ ing .
My parents and 11 of us s@@ ib@@ l@@ ings fl@@ ed for our lives with only the clo@@ th@@ es on our b@@ ac@@ ks .
How did Jesus and many of his disciples become ref@@ ug@@ e@@ es ?
He said : “ When they persec@@ u@@ te you in one city , f@@ le@@ e to another . ”
( b ) are living in a cam@@ p ?
My fe@@ et were so s@@ w@@ oll@@ en that I told my family to go on without me .
My father ​ — not about to ab@@ and@@ on me to the re@@ b@@ el for@@ ces — ​ car@@ ri@@ ed me .
They g@@ os@@ si@@ ped , dr@@ an@@ k , g@@ am@@ bl@@ ed , st@@ o@@ le , and were immor@@ al . ”
( Read 1 John 3 : 17 , 18 . )
( b ) Why do they need our pati@@ ent help ?
They need to see that we care about them .
( b ) How can ref@@ ug@@ e@@ es show gr@@ ati@@ t@@ ude ?
How can we help our brothers and sisters who are ref@@ ug@@ e@@ es ?
( a ) What temp@@ tation do ref@@ ug@@ e@@ es need to res@@ ist ?
F@@ in@@ ally , he held up the emp@@ ty b@@ a@@ g and said with a s@@ mi@@ le : ‘ You see ?
This is all you need ! ’ ” ​ — Read 1 Timothy 6 : 8 .
They need to sense Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s love and comp@@ as@@ sion among their fellow Christians .
Many of t@@ od@@ ay@@ ’@@ s ref@@ ug@@ e@@ es come from coun@@ tr@@ ies where our preaching work is res@@ tr@@ ic@@ ted .
She said : “ The brothers there tre@@ ated them like close relati@@ ves , provid@@ ing food , clo@@ th@@ es , sh@@ el@@ ter , and tr@@ an@@ sp@@ or@@ tation .
Who el@@ se would w@@ el@@ come str@@ ang@@ ers into their home just because they worship the same God ?
On@@ ly Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses ! ” ​ — Read John 13 : 35 .
In the mean@@ time , they can ask dis@@ cre@@ et questions about a ref@@ ug@@ e@@ e@@ ’@@ s congregation and ministry to dis@@ cer@@ n his spiritual con@@ dition .
“ No greater joy do I have than this : that I should hear that my children go on wal@@ king in the truth . ” ​ — 3 J@@ O@@ H@@ N 4 .
How can parents set a good example for their children ?
How can family head@@ s dec@@ ide which language congregation the family will att@@ end ?
How can others help imm@@ i@@ gr@@ ant parents and their children ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What probl@@ em do many imm@@ i@@ gr@@ ant children experience ?
( b ) What questions will this article discus@@ s ?
“ But after I started school , I began to pre@@ fer the local language .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in a few years , the shi@@ f@@ t was complete .
I cou@@ ld@@ n@@ ’@@ t understand the meetings , and I di@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t identi@@ fy with my parents ’ cul@@ ture . ”
3 , 4 . ( a ) How can parents set a good example for their children ?
( b ) What should parents not exp@@ ect of their children ?
When your children see you “ seek@@ ing first the Kingdom , ” they learn to dep@@ end on Jehovah for their d@@ a@@ ily needs .
N@@ ever get so bus@@ y that you do not have time for your children .
How may your children benefit from lear@@ ning your language ?
Par@@ ents , if that describ@@ es your children , can you learn at le@@ ast some of the local language ?
A child who commun@@ ic@@ ates best in another sp@@ oken language des@@ er@@ ves the same concer@@ n , would you not ag@@ ree ?
If that is your situation , you can still help your children to come to know and love Jehovah .
“ But when we saw her stud@@ ying , pray@@ ing , and doing her best to conduct family worship every we@@ ek , we under@@ stood that g@@ etting to know Jehovah was very important . ”
How can parents help children who may need to study in two langu@@ ages ?
( a ) Who must dec@@ ide which language congregation to att@@ end ?
That may not be the case when children do not fully understand the language .
( Read 1 Corinthians 14 : 9 , 11 . )
T@@ o@@ gether , we reg@@ ularly att@@ ended meetings and shar@@ ed in the ministry .
We also inv@@ ited local friends to jo@@ in us for me@@ als and exc@@ ur@@ sions .
All of this helped our children to get to know the brothers and to get to know Jehovah , not only as their God but also as their Father and F@@ ri@@ end .
We considered this to be much more important than their m@@ as@@ ter@@ ing our language . ”
Samuel ad@@ ds : “ To keep ourselves spiritually strong , my wife and I also att@@ ended meetings in our language .
Life was very bus@@ y , and we were ti@@ red .
But we than@@ k Jehovah for blessing our efforts and sacrifi@@ ces .
Our three children are all serving Jehovah in the full - time ministry . ”
“ I knew the bas@@ ic@@ s of my parents ’ language , but the language sp@@ oken at the meetings was over my head , ” rec@@ alls K@@ ris@@ t@@ ina .
“ When I was 12 , I att@@ ended a conven@@ tion in my school language .
For the first time , I under@@ stood that what I was hear@@ ing was the truth !
Y@@ oun@@ g people , do you think that you would pre@@ fer being part of a local - language congregation ?
“ When my s@@ ib@@ l@@ ings and I got into our te@@ ens , we wanted to s@@ wit@@ ch to the local - language congregation , ” says N@@ adi@@ a , who now ser@@ ves at Bethel .
“ Now we@@ ’@@ re gr@@ at@@ eful that our parents wor@@ ked hard to teach us their language and kept us in the for@@ ei@@ gn - language congregation .
It has en@@ ri@@ ched our lives and br@@ o@@ ad@@ ened our opport@@ un@@ ities to help others get to know Jehovah . ”
( b ) How can parents get help in teaching their children the truth ?
( Read Proverbs 1 : 8 ; 31 : 10 , 27 , 28 . )
Still , parents who do not know the local language may need help to reach their chil@@ dr@@ en@@ ’@@ s heart .
B@@ oth children and parents benefit from associ@@ ation with the congregation ( See par@@ ag@@ r@@ aph@@ s 18 , 19 )
( b ) What must parents continue to do ?
“ When they helped me with stud@@ ent talk assign@@ ments for the meeting , I always learned more .
And I enjoy@@ ed the le@@ is@@ ure activities we shar@@ ed in as a group . ”
Par@@ ents , pray to Jehovah for help , and try your best .
( Read 2 Chronicles 15 : 7 . )
P@@ ut your chil@@ d@@ ’@@ s friend@@ ship with Jehovah ah@@ ead of your own inter@@ ests .
But it w@@ as@@ n@@ ’@@ t until 19@@ 46 that I really under@@ stood Bible truth .
Ev@@ entually , I learned si@@ gn language and had f@@ u@@ n pl@@ aying with the other children .
She accepted a magazine sub@@ s@@ crip@@ tion and wanted me to meet her husband , G@@ ary .
Ev@@ entually , fi@@ ve from their class became Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
At that time , she gave me a pi@@ ece of c@@ and@@ y and asked if we could be friends .
When she wanted to get baptized , her parents told her , “ Bec@@ ome one of Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , and you will have to leave our home ! ”
She continued her study and later got baptized .
When we got married in 19@@ 60 , her parents did not come to our w@@ ed@@ ding .
My son N@@ ic@@ hol@@ as and his wife , D@@ eb@@ or@@ ah , serve at L@@ on@@ don Bethel
F@@ a@@ ye and James , Jer@@ ry and Ev@@ el@@ y@@ n , Sh@@ ann@@ an and St@@ even
We are now part of the C@@ al@@ g@@ ary S@@ i@@ gn - L@@ angu@@ age Con@@ greg@@ ation , where I continue to serve as an el@@ der .
How can we keep our love for Jehovah strong ?
How can we deep@@ en our love for Bible truth ?
Why is it important to have affec@@ tion for our brothers ?
What may have ca@@ used the love of some Christians to gr@@ ow co@@ ld ?
People today have less and less love for God .
S@@ how love for Jehovah ( See par@@ ag@@ r@@ ap@@ h 10 )
( Read Psalm 119 : 9@@ 7 - 1@@ 00 . )
S@@ how love for Bible truth ( See par@@ ag@@ r@@ ap@@ h 14 )
On his last night on earth , Jesus said to his disciples : “ I am giving you a new command@@ ment , that you love one another ; just as I have loved you , you also love one another .
By this all will know that you are my disciples ​ — if you have love among y@@ ourselves . ” ​ — John 13 : 34 , 35 .
S@@ how love for the brothers and sisters ( See par@@ ag@@ r@@ ap@@ h 17 )
What are some ways in which we can show love ?
Read 1 Thessalon@@ ians 4 : 9 , 10 .
“ Sim@@ on son of John , do you love me more than these ? ” ​ — J@@ O@@ H@@ N 21 : 15 .
So they c@@ ast it , but they were not able to ha@@ ul it in because of the large number of f@@ ish . ” ​ — John 21 : 1 - 6 .
( b ) What valu@@ able less@@ on did a brother in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and learn about his work ?
As a result , it left me al@@ most no time for spiritual matters .
I fin@@ ally reali@@ zed that in order to put Kingdom inter@@ ests first , I needed to change my line of work . ”
“ After pl@@ an@@ ning for about a year , ” he explained , “ I dec@@ ided to become a st@@ re@@ et v@@ end@@ or and sel@@ l ice cre@@ am .
In the begin@@ ning , I str@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed fin@@ anci@@ ally and got dis@@ courag@@ ed .
When I met my form@@ er work@@ m@@ ates , they would la@@ u@@ gh at me and ask why I thought sel@@ ling ice cre@@ am was better than working with comp@@ ut@@ ers in an ai@@ r - con@@ di@@ ti@@ oned en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment .
I pray@@ ed to Jehovah , as@@ king him to help me to c@@ ope and to reach my go@@ al of having more time for spiritual activities .
I got better ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ ted with my cus@@ t@@ om@@ ers ’ t@@ astes and became more sk@@ ill@@ ful in making ice cre@@ am .
S@@ oon , I was sel@@ ling all my ice cre@@ am every day .
Ac@@ tually , I was better - off fin@@ anci@@ ally than when I wor@@ ked with comp@@ ut@@ ers .
It has made me happ@@ i@@ er because I do not have the str@@ ess and wor@@ ry that I had with my form@@ er jo@@ b .
And most important , I now feel clos@@ er to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Matthew 5 : 3 , 6 .
After his baptism , he said : “ The only re@@ gre@@ t I have is that I lost so much time before I reali@@ zed that serving Jehovah br@@ ings far more happiness than pur@@ su@@ ing the ent@@ er@@ tain@@ ment offered by this world . ”
Jesus stated that “ no one can slave for two m@@ ast@@ ers . ”
He ad@@ ded : “ You cannot slave for God and for Ri@@ ches . ”
( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 14 . )
See the article “ Is Your R@@ ec@@ re@@ ation B@@ en@@ efi@@ cial ? ”
We also shar@@ ed reg@@ ularly in the field ministry . ”
We were so s@@ ad to leave our Bible students beh@@ ind . ”
But then , a mon@@ th later , they received thr@@ ill@@ ing news .
M@@ i@@ ri@@ am says : “ We were inv@@ ited to serve as special pione@@ ers .
What a joy to be able to stay in our assignment ! ”
They tr@@ us@@ ted in the promise found at Psalm 37 : 5 : “ Comm@@ it your way to Jehovah ; rely on him , and he will act in your beh@@ alf . ”
Today we do , and we l@@ ack nothing of real import@@ ance . ”
Why can we exp@@ ect that marriage and family life will invol@@ ve some tri@@ als ?
We can be sure that he wants the best for us , as he did for his servants in the past . ​ — Read Jeremiah 29 : 11 , 12 .
( Read 1 Samuel 1 : 4 - 7 . )
“ Even though An@@ n was not rel@@ ated to me , I found her loving concer@@ n to be such a help , ” P@@ a@@ ul@@ a expl@@ ains .
“ It helped me to keep serving Jehovah . ”
( Read Psalm 14@@ 5 : 18 , 19 . )
“ Wh@@ ere your t@@ reas@@ ure is , there your hearts will be also . ” ​ — L@@ U@@ KE 12 : 34 .
As we do so , medi@@ tate on how you person@@ ally can deep@@ en your love for these spiritual t@@ reas@@ ures .
Can you im@@ ag@@ ine how preci@@ ous that p@@ ear@@ l was to him ?
( Read Mark 10 : 28 - 30 . )
( a ) Why did the apostle Paul describ@@ e our ministry as a “ t@@ reas@@ ure in ear@@ then v@@ ess@@ els ” ?
( Read Romans 1 : 14 , 15 ; 2 Timothy 4 : 2 . )
I@@ r@@ ene says , “ When I think of other go@@ als I could have pur@@ su@@ ed , I can@@ ’@@ t im@@ ag@@ ine one that would have brought me more joy . ”
What is the “ t@@ reas@@ ure st@@ ore ” that Jesus refer@@ red to at Matthew 13 : 5@@ 2 , and how do we f@@ ill it ?
( Read Proverbs 2 : 4 - 7 . )
Consider the experience of a brother named Peter .
To t@@ est Peter , the r@@ ab@@ b@@ i asked , “ So , my bo@@ y , what language was the book of Daniel written in ? ”
When I went home and ch@@ ec@@ ked the Watchtower and Aw@@ ake !
magaz@@ ines from the pre@@ vi@@ ous months , I found an article expl@@ aining that Daniel was written in Ar@@ am@@ ai@@ c . ”
As you do this , you will build up “ t@@ reas@@ ure in the heavens , where no th@@ i@@ ef g@@ ets near and no m@@ oth con@@ su@@ mes .
For where your t@@ reas@@ ure is , there your hearts will be also . ” ​ — Luke 12 : 33 , 34 .
“ I had tr@@ oub@@ le g@@ etting along with a brother who wor@@ ked with me .
On@@ ce when we were y@@ ell@@ ing at each other , two people came in and wit@@ n@@ essed our bl@@ ow@@ up . ” ​ — C@@ H@@ R@@ I@@ S .
“ A sister with whom I often pre@@ ached s@@ ud@@ den@@ ly ended our arrang@@ ements for the ministry .
I had no id@@ ea why . ” ​ — J@@ AN@@ E@@ T .
“ I was on a three - person ph@@ one call .
One of the others said good - b@@ ye , and I thought he was off the line .
I then said un@@ kind things about him to the other person on the ph@@ one , but the first person had not h@@ un@@ g up . ” ​ — M@@ I@@ C@@ H@@ A@@ E@@ L .
“ In our congregation , two pione@@ ers began having problems .
Their b@@ ick@@ ering was dis@@ courag@@ ing to others . ” ​ — G@@ AR@@ Y .
“ Do not become up@@ set with one another on the way . ”
“ P@@ l@@ ans fai@@ l when there is no cons@@ ul@@ tation . ”
Mic@@ ha@@ el says , “ My brother gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely for@@ gave me . ”
“ Con@@ t@@ in@@ ue put@@ ting up with one another and for@@ giving one another fre@@ ely even if anyone has a cause for compl@@ ain@@ t against another . ”
Now they get along well as they preach the good news .
That differ@@ ence may se@@ em un@@ important ; yet , it can lead to serious problems . ”
As my ir@@ rit@@ ation gre@@ w , I started being c@@ ur@@ t with her .
I thought , ‘ She does not show me the respect I des@@ er@@ ve , so I am not going to show her respect . ’ ”
“ I began se@@ e@@ ing my own person@@ ality f@@ la@@ ws , and I was very dis@@ appointed in my@@ self .
I reali@@ zed that I had to ad@@ just my thinking .
After pray@@ ing to Jehovah about the matter , I b@@ ought the sister a small gift and wrote her a c@@ ard to ap@@ olo@@ gi@@ ze for my bad attitude .
We hu@@ g@@ ged each other and ag@@ re@@ ed to put the matter beh@@ ind us .
We have not had any more problems . ”
F@@ O@@ R many people today , money is the bi@@ g is@@ sue .
Why must the is@@ sue of s@@ overei@@ g@@ nt@@ y be s@@ et@@ t@@ led ?
How important is the v@@ indic@@ ation of Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s s@@ overei@@ g@@ nt@@ y ?
Why , from the day our for@@ ef@@ ath@@ ers f@@ ell as@@ le@@ ep in death , all things are continu@@ ing ex@@ ac@@ tly as they were from cre@@ ati@@ on@@ ’@@ s begin@@ ning . ”
( Read Isaiah 55 : 10 , 11 . )
( Read Job 1 : 7 - 12 . )
( Read Job 38 : 18 - 21 . )
( Read Romans 5 : 3 - 5 . )
One reason is that he rul@@ es with love .

If you are gri@@ ev@@ ing , you too can find so@@ othing comfort from such s@@ crip@@ tures as the following :
( Read 1 Thessalon@@ ians 5 : 11 . )
What do we need to remember about gri@@ ef ?
Even when someone does expr@@ ess how he fe@@ els , it is not always eas@@ y for others to understand what he is tr@@ ying to say .
At that m@@ om@@ ent , I d@@ on@@ ’@@ t feel qu@@ ite so alone in my gri@@ ef . ”

What pl@@ ans can lead to a happy future for you ?
What could a life in the pioneer service lead to ?
Y@@ O@@ U young ones will prob@@ ably ag@@ ree that before star@@ ting a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , it is wise to pl@@ an where you will go .
Life is like a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , and the time to pl@@ an where you want to go is when you are young .
How do you know that Jehovah wants you to pl@@ an for a happy future ?
Your Creator is “ the God of love , ” “ the happy God , ” who made humans “ in his im@@ age . ”
You will be happy when you imitate our loving God .
Jesus Christ set the perfect example for you young ones .
Jesus also d@@ re@@ w close to Jehovah by stud@@ ying the Scriptures .
“ P@@ l@@ ans fai@@ l when there is no cons@@ ul@@ tation , but there is accompl@@ ish@@ ment through many ad@@ vis@@ ers . ”
As with any car@@ e@@ er , you need time to become sk@@ ill@@ ed .
At first , I cou@@ ld@@ n@@ ’@@ t star@@ t any Bible studi@@ es , but later I moved to another ter@@ rit@@ ory , and within a mon@@ th I started sever@@ al studi@@ es .
One stud@@ ent began coming to the Kingdom Hall .
For example , Jacob , from N@@ or@@ th Ameri@@ ca , writ@@ es : “ When I was s@@ even , many of my cl@@ ass@@ m@@ ates were V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese .
I wanted to tell them about Jehovah , so after a while I made pl@@ ans to learn their language .
For the most part , I learned by com@@ par@@ ing the Engl@@ ish and V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese edi@@ tions of The Watchtower .
I also made friends in a n@@ ear@@ by V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese - language congregation .
When I was 18 , I started pione@@ ering .
L@@ ater , I att@@ ended the Bible S@@ cho@@ ol for S@@ ing@@ le Br@@ others .
This helped me with my present pioneer assignment , where I am the only el@@ der in a V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese - language group .
Many V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese people are am@@ a@@ zed that I have learned their language .
They in@@ vi@@ te me in , and often I can study the Bible with them .
Some have progr@@ essed to baptism . ” ​ — C@@ om@@ p@@ are Acts 2 : 7 , 8 .
I enjoy encourag@@ ing the young brothers in our congregation and se@@ e@@ ing their spiritual progr@@ ess .
After I att@@ ended the Bible S@@ cho@@ ol for S@@ ing@@ le Br@@ others , I received a new pioneer assignment .
It@@ ’@@ s true that I have never found anyone in the ter@@ rit@@ ory who progr@@ essed to baptism , but others have .
How may pioneer service lead to other opport@@ un@@ ities ?
A brother named K@@ ev@@ in says : “ E@@ ver since I was a little bo@@ y , I have wanted to serve Jehovah full - time som@@ ed@@ ay .
F@@ in@@ ally , I started pione@@ ering when I was 19 .
I supp@@ or@@ ted my@@ self working part - time for a brother who was a buil@@ der .
I learned to inst@@ all ro@@ of@@ s , w@@ ind@@ ow@@ s , and do@@ ors .
L@@ ater , I sp@@ ent two years with a hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e reli@@ ef te@@ am , re@@ building Kingdom H@@ alls and ho@@ mes for the brothers .
When I heard about the con@@ struc@@ tion needs in S@@ outh Africa , I app@@ lied and was inv@@ ited to go .
H@@ ere in Africa , I move from one Kingdom Hall pro@@ ject to another every few we@@ ek@@ s .
We live together , study the Bible together , and work together .
I also enjoy preaching with the local brothers each we@@ ek .
The pl@@ ans I made as a bo@@ y have made me happy in ways I did not for@@ es@@ ee . ”
Bethel service is a happy way of life because everything you do there is for Jehovah .
After a year and a h@@ alf , I was inv@@ ited to Bethel , where I learned to op@@ er@@ ate prin@@ ting pr@@ esses and later to do comp@@ ut@@ er pro@@ g@@ ra@@ mm@@ ing .
At Bethel , I enjoy hear@@ ing fir@@ s@@ th@@ and about the progr@@ ess of the disci@@ ple - making activ@@ ity world@@ wide .
I love serving here because what we do helps people to draw close to Jehovah . ”
You can be sure that Jehovah wants you to “ get a fir@@ m hold ” on a happy future .
( Read 1 Timothy 6 : 18 , 19 . )
Then pl@@ an to do what is pleas@@ ing to him .
He has studi@@ ed human be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or since man was cre@@ ated .

Jesus said : “ Do not fear those who k@@ ill the body and after this are not able to do anything more . ”
Do not be struc@@ k with ter@@ r@@ or or fear , for Jehovah your God is with you wh@@ er@@ ever you go . ”
L@@ ist@@ en to Jehovah and trust in him in all that you do .
The second article high@@ ligh@@ ts how Jehovah can do the un@@ expec@@ ted by accompl@@ ish@@ ing things we could never im@@ ag@@ ine .
Like the f@@ ar@@ m@@ er , we need to wa@@ it pati@@ ently .
What can we learn from the example of the prophet Micah ?
( Read Micah 7 : 1 - 3 . )
If we have faith like that of Micah , we will be willing to wa@@ it for Jehovah .
So we “ end@@ ure fully with pati@@ ence and joy . ”
Abraham had to wa@@ it many years before his gr@@ and@@ sons Es@@ a@@ u and Jacob were born ( See par@@ ag@@ r@@ aph@@ s 9 , 10 )
( Read Hebrews 11 : 8 - 12 . )
But just im@@ ag@@ ine Abra@@ h@@ am@@ ’@@ s joy when he is resurrec@@ ted back to a paradise earth .
Although you me@@ ant to har@@ m me , God in@@ tend@@ ed it to turn out well and to pres@@ er@@ ve many people ali@@ ve , as he is doing today . ”
( b ) What helped David to wa@@ it pati@@ ently ?
I will s@@ ing to Jehovah , for he has ri@@ ch@@ ly re@@ war@@ ded me . ”
( Read 2 Peter 3 : 9 . )
What will help us to be willing to wa@@ it pati@@ ently ?
What less@@ ons do we learn from what happened to the apostle Paul in Philippi ?
( Read Acts 16 : 8 - 10 . )
S@@ oon after he arri@@ ved in M@@ ac@@ ed@@ on@@ ia , he ended up in pris@@ on !
Why did Jehovah allow this to happ@@ en to Paul ?
B@@ oth he and S@@ il@@ as started “ pray@@ ing and pra@@ ising God with s@@ ong . ”
4 , 5 . ( a ) How could our situation be similar to that of Paul ?
( b ) How did P@@ a@@ ul@@ ’@@ s situation change un@@ expec@@ t@@ edly ?
What will we now discus@@ s and re@@ view together ?
( Read 1 Peter 5 : 6 , 7 . )
S@@ om@@ etimes he sur@@ pris@@ es us by doing the un@@ expec@@ ted .
Jehovah sent an angel to destr@@ o@@ y 18@@ 5@@ ,000 of S@@ enn@@ ach@@ er@@ ib@@ ’@@ s sol@@ di@@ ers in one night .
( a ) What less@@ on do we learn from what happened to Joseph ?
No doubt Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s actions exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ed all of Josep@@ h@@ ’@@ s expec@@ t@@ ations .
Th@@ ink , too , about Josep@@ h@@ ’@@ s great - gr@@ and@@ mother Sarah .
( Read Isaiah 43 : 10 - 13 . )
We know that Jehovah car@@ es for us and wants us to succ@@ eed .
How can we str@@ i@@ p off and keep off the old person@@ ality ?
By 19@@ 39 there were 6@@ ,000 of them in the [ conc@@ entr@@ ation cam@@ ps ] . ”
But most of all , you are truly m@@ ul@@ ti@@ r@@ ac@@ ial . ”
But the more I had s@@ ex@@ ual rel@@ ations , the more ins@@ ec@@ ure I felt . ”
This way of life continued until S@@ ak@@ ur@@ a was 23 years old .
It got so bad that I could not wa@@ it for the woman I was living with to leave the house so that I could w@@ atch por@@ no@@ gr@@ ap@@ hi@@ c v@@ ide@@ os . ”
What helped St@@ eph@@ en to put away anger and ab@@ usi@@ ve spe@@ ech ?
He says : “ Our family life im@@ proved dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c@@ ally .
Today , St@@ eph@@ en ser@@ ves as a min@@ ist@@ eri@@ al serv@@ ant , and his wife has been a reg@@ ular pioneer for sever@@ al years .
Bible t@@ ex@@ ts that encourag@@ ed me were Isaiah 55 : 7 , which says : ‘ Let the wicked man leave his way , ’ and 1 Corinthians 6 : 11 , which says about those who had ab@@ and@@ oned sin@@ ful ways : ‘ And yet that is what some of you were . ’
For many years , Jehovah pati@@ ently helped me by means of his holy spirit to put on the new person@@ ality . ”
We also benefit from God@@ ’@@ s Word and his holy spirit when we pre@@ p@@ are for and att@@ end congregation meetings .
Some of the n@@ ames in this article have been chang@@ ed .
See chapter 25 in the book Qu@@ es@@ tions Y@@ oun@@ g People As@@ k ​ — A@@ ns@@ w@@ ers That Wor@@ k , V@@ olu@@ me 1 .

He stated : “ There is nei@@ ther Greek nor Jew , circum@@ c@@ ision nor un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision , for@@ ei@@ gn@@ er , S@@ cy@@ th@@ i@@ an , slave , or fre@@ em@@ an . ”
( a ) How do servants of Jehovah need to tre@@ at others ?
( See op@@ ening pic@@ ture . ) ( b ) What have been the resul@@ ts ?
Then he att@@ ended a meeting of Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
You get to experience our world@@ wide br@@ other@@ ho@@ od and see its mirac@@ ul@@ ous unity fir@@ s@@ th@@ and . ”
When we showed them s@@ crip@@ tures from their P@@ or@@ tu@@ gu@@ ese Bible , such as Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 or Psalm 37 : 10 , 11 , 29 , they p@@ aid attention and som@@ etimes even sh@@ ed t@@ ears . ”
We are so than@@ k@@ ful to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Acts 10 : 34 , 35 .
What example did Jesus set in show@@ ing mil@@ d@@ ness and pati@@ ence ?
Then he ad@@ ded : “ If you continue show@@ ing fav@@ or@@ iti@@ sm , you are comm@@ it@@ ting sin . ”
Why is it important that we clo@@ the ourselves with love ?
L@@ ove is also “ pati@@ ent and kind ” and “ does not get p@@ uf@@ f@@ ed up . ”
Paul said that without love , he was “ nothing . ”
The love is in this respect , not that we have loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son as a prop@@ iti@@ at@@ ory sacrifice for our sins . ”
Jesus said : “ No one has love greater than this , that someone should sur@@ rend@@ er his life in beh@@ alf of his friends . ”
Let us consider how we can do so .
John wrote : “ L@@ it@@ tle children , we should love , not in word or with the t@@ ong@@ ue , but in deed and truth . ”
But then I asked my@@ self , ‘ How can I imitate Jesus in deal@@ ing with this person ? ’
After refl@@ ec@@ ting on what Jesus would have done , I dec@@ ided to let the matter go and not make an is@@ sue of it .
L@@ ater , I learned that my c@@ ow@@ or@@ k@@ er had been cop@@ ing with a serious health probl@@ em and was under a l@@ ot of str@@ ess .
I concl@@ ud@@ ed that she prob@@ ably did not really mean what she wrote .
R@@ ef@@ l@@ ec@@ ting on Jesus ’ example of show@@ ing love even when prov@@ ok@@ ed helped me to show similar love to my c@@ ow@@ or@@ k@@ er . ”
By lea@@ ving heaven , “ he emp@@ ti@@ ed himself ” in our beh@@ alf , even “ to the point of death . ”
P@@ E@@ A@@ C@@ E : “ P@@ ut@@ ting up with one another in love ” allow@@ s us to enjoy “ the un@@ iting b@@ ond of peace . ”
W@@ ould you not ag@@ ree that such a pe@@ ac@@ eful spirit is truly uni@@ qu@@ e in t@@ od@@ ay@@ ’@@ s div@@ ided world ?
Paul wrote : “ L@@ ove buil@@ ds up . ”
The following day , they had out@@ gr@@ own the ven@@ ue . ”
B@@ el@@ ow the pic@@ ture was the cap@@ tion : “ In@@ v@@ asi@@ on of the st@@ re@@ ets . ”

How can you help your children to devel@@ op self - control ?
( Read Exodus 34 : 5 - 7 . )
( b ) Why should you be inter@@ ested in what the Bible says about comp@@ as@@ sion ?
( a ) Why did Jehovah s@@ end angels to S@@ od@@ om ?
( Read Exodus 22 : 26 , 27 . )
We read : “ Jehovah the God of their for@@ ef@@ ath@@ ers kept war@@ ning them by means of his mess@@ eng@@ ers , war@@ ning them again and again , because he felt comp@@ as@@ sion for his people and for his d@@ well@@ ing place . ”
“ He started to teach them many things . ”
Instead , we need to do all we can now to help people .
One meaning of comp@@ as@@ sion is “ to suf@@ fer together . ”
“ Be courag@@ e@@ ous and strong and go to work .
How can young ones and their parents show courage ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What important assignment did Solomon receive ?
To succ@@ eed , Solomon would need to be courag@@ e@@ ous and go to work .
What could Solomon learn about courage from his father ?
( Read 1 Chronicles 28 : 20 . )
How did Jesus ’ courage af@@ fect the apostles ?
Let us consider two ar@@ e@@ as of life where we need courage : in our family and in the congregation .
( b ) How can young ones imitate Moses ’ example ?
He will help them provide for the needs of their famil@@ ies .
She writ@@ es : “ Gr@@ owing up , I was really sh@@ y .
I could b@@ ar@@ ely talk to people at the Kingdom Hall , much less kn@@ o@@ ck on the do@@ ors of complete str@@ ang@@ ers . ”
With the help of her parents and others in the congregation , this young Christian ac@@ hi@@ ev@@ ed her go@@ al of becom@@ ing a reg@@ ular pioneer .
How can Psalm 37 : 25 and Hebrews 13 : 5 help parents ?
( Read Psalm 37 : 25 ; Hebrews 13 : 5 . )
A brother who has two children wrote : “ Many parents exp@@ end much effort and res@@ our@@ ces helping their children reach go@@ als in such ar@@ e@@ as as sp@@ or@@ ts , rec@@ re@@ ation , and educ@@ ation .
It makes so much more sense to exp@@ end effort and res@@ our@@ ces in helping our children reach go@@ als that will help them to maintain a good standing with Jehovah .
It has been a great s@@ ource of satis@@ fac@@ tion not only to see our children reach spiritual go@@ als but to share the j@@ our@@ ne@@ y with them . ”
G@@ ive examples of courage in the Christian congregation .
( a ) How can baptized brothers be courag@@ e@@ ous ?
( Read Philippians 2 : 13 ; 4 : 13 . )
We ur@@ ge all baptized brothers to be courag@@ e@@ ous and work hard for the congregation !
Therefore , “ be courag@@ e@@ ous . . . and go to work . ”
1 , 2 . ( a ) What would life be like without the Bible ?
The apostle Peter qu@@ oted Isaiah 40 : 8 .
( Read 1 Peter 1 : 24 , 25 . )
( a ) How do langu@@ ages change over time ?

T@@ ake time to expl@@ ain , illustr@@ ate , and apply vers@@ es that you read
“ A tur@@ ning point came about 15 years after I was baptized .
During a talk at the Kingdom Hall . . . , the spe@@ ak@@ er refer@@ red to James 1 : 23 , 24 .
I began to won@@ der if what I saw in my@@ self was different from what Jehovah saw .
“ A few days later , I read a s@@ crip@@ ture that chang@@ ed my life .
The verse was Isaiah 1 : 18 , where Jehovah is qu@@ oted as saying : ‘ C@@ ome , now , you people , and let us set matters str@@ ai@@ ght between us . . . .
Th@@ ough the sins of you people should prove to be as s@@ car@@ let , they will be made whi@@ te just like s@@ now . ’
I felt as if Jehovah were speaking to me , saying : ‘ C@@ ome on , V@@ ick@@ y , let@@ ’@@ s set matters str@@ ai@@ ght between us .
I know you , I know your sins , I know your heart ​ — and I love you . ’
“ I was un@@ able to s@@ le@@ ep that night .

The following year , I was appointed as a special pioneer , along with Mary H@@ en@@ shall .
We were sent to un@@ assi@@ gned ter@@ rit@@ ory in the count@@ y of Ch@@ es@@ hi@@ re .
It is a great joy to know that there are now many Witnesses in that area .
My brother and his wife , L@@ ot@@ tie , were already serving as special pione@@ ers in N@@ or@@ ther@@ n I@@ rel@@ and , and in 195@@ 2 the four of us att@@ ended a distr@@ ic@@ t conven@@ tion in B@@ el@@ f@@ ast .
That night the four of us s@@ l@@ ept in the c@@ ar .
Am@@ az@@ ingly , we had no probl@@ em par@@ king the tr@@ ail@@ er on the prop@@ er@@ ty of friend@@ ly f@@ ar@@ m@@ ers .
We really enjoy@@ ed our assignment in the circuit work .

He started to att@@ end Christian meetings reg@@ ularly , to study God@@ ’@@ s Word ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly , and to make d@@ a@@ ily prayer a hab@@ it .
‘ I@@ ’@@ ve known the truth for years , ’ he said , ‘ and I@@ ’@@ ve even served as a pioneer .

After every congregation meeting , no matter how bus@@ y they were , at le@@ ast one of them would ask how I was .
Because of my past , I found it difficult to feel wor@@ thy of God@@ ’@@ s love .
Tim@@ e and time again , however , Jehovah has used the congregation and the elders to con@@ fir@@ m his love for me .
I pray that I will never let him go . ”

L@@ ater , my mother gave bir@@ th to my two youn@@ ger brothers and my youn@@ ger sister .
D@@ U@@ R@@ ING my school years , not much chang@@ ed .
The t@@ own of L@@ ib@@ er@@ ty was sur@@ r@@ ound@@ ed by small f@@ ar@@ ms , and the b@@ asi@@ c cr@@ op was cor@@ n .
She took us to the B@@ apti@@ st church every S@@ und@@ ay .
They wanted me to make the mil@@ it@@ ary my car@@ e@@ er .
This time , however , they inv@@ ited me to come to a Con@@ greg@@ ation Bo@@ ok St@@ ud@@ y , a small meeting for Bible study and discus@@ sion that was held in their home .
I told them I would think about it .
I cou@@ ld@@ n@@ ’@@ t believe how much they knew about the Bible !
Y@@ ears before , when I asked my mother about Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , she simply said , “ O@@ h , they worship some old man named Jehovah . ”
But I now felt that my eyes were being op@@ ened !
I started pione@@ ering the next year , in 195@@ 8 .
G@@ l@@ or@@ ia was a j@@ ew@@ el then , and she is a j@@ ew@@ el today .
G@@ l@@ or@@ ia and I got married in F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary of 195@@ 9 .
A d@@ ear brother , Sim@@ on K@@ r@@ ak@@ er , inter@@ view@@ ed us .
He told us that Bethel was not accep@@ ting married cou@@ ples at that time .
M@@ ost of our j@@ ob@@ s p@@ aid three d@@ oll@@ ar@@ s a day .
E@@ ach we@@ ek , G@@ l@@ or@@ ia did ir@@ on@@ ing for one family .
I remember one time when we st@@ op@@ ped at a g@@ as st@@ ation .
On the other hand , we had wonderful times with the brothers , and we loved our ministry !
M@@ e@@ an@@ while , I started a study with the cou@@ pl@@ e@@ ’@@ s daugh@@ ter and her husband .
M@@ other and daugh@@ ter both dec@@ ided to serve Jehovah and got baptized .
We had d@@ ear friends in the whi@@ te congregation .
The K@@ u K@@ l@@ u@@ x K@@ l@@ an ( K@@ K@@ K ) , an organization that prom@@ ot@@ es r@@ ac@@ ism and viol@@ ence , was very ac@@ tive then .
In 19@@ 6@@ 2 , I was inv@@ ited to att@@ end the Kingdom M@@ in@@ is@@ try S@@ cho@@ ol at S@@ outh L@@ ans@@ ing , New York .
However , a t@@ el@@ eph@@ one comp@@ any in P@@ ine B@@ l@@ uf@@ f had inter@@ view@@ ed me for a jo@@ b .
If they hi@@ red me , I would be the first bl@@ ack man to work for that comp@@ any .
I had no money to trav@@ el to New York .
She said , “ G@@ o to school and learn as much as you can , and come back and teach us ! ”
I am so gl@@ ad that I did not take that jo@@ b !
H@@ ere is how G@@ l@@ or@@ ia rem@@ embers our time in P@@ ine B@@ l@@ uf@@ f : “ I f@@ ell in love with the ter@@ rit@@ ory !
So we would go in the house - to - house work in the mor@@ ning and then conduct Bible studi@@ es the rest of the day , som@@ etimes until 11 o@@ ’@@ clo@@ ck at night .
While we were pione@@ ering in P@@ ine B@@ l@@ uf@@ f , we app@@ lied to become special pione@@ ers .
Brother Le@@ on W@@ ea@@ ver , now the co@@ ord@@ in@@ at@@ or of the United States Br@@ an@@ ch Comm@@ it@@ te@@ e , was appointed to serve as a circuit overse@@ er at the same time .
I was n@@ er@@ v@@ ous about becom@@ ing a circuit overse@@ er .
After I was appointed , Brother Tho@@ m@@ p@@ son was the first distr@@ ic@@ t overse@@ er I served with .
In those days , a circuit overse@@ er received little training .
I remember saying to G@@ l@@ or@@ ia , “ Does he really have to leave now ? ”
One time , the K@@ K@@ K held a mar@@ ch in a t@@ own we were vis@@ iting in T@@ enn@@ ess@@ ee .
The following mon@@ th , we began our Bethel service .
G@@ l@@ or@@ ia was a j@@ ew@@ el when I married her , and she still is
Then in 199@@ 9 , I was appointed to be a m@@ ember of the G@@ over@@ ning B@@ ody .
Isaiah 32 : 17 says : “ The result of true righteousness will be peace , and the fru@@ it@@ age of true righteousness will be lasting tr@@ an@@ qu@@ ill@@ ity and sec@@ ur@@ ity . ”
S@@ ec@@ ond , we must pray for God@@ ’@@ s holy spirit .

So I gre@@ et@@ ed her in her own t@@ ong@@ ue .
T@@ aken by sur@@ pr@@ ise , she asked me , ‘ What is the reason for your vis@@ it ? ’
I p@@ ol@@ it@@ ely told her that I w@@ ished to see the H@@ i@@ gh Comm@@ is@@ sion@@ er .
She t@@ el@@ eph@@ oned the offi@@ cial , who came out to meet me and gre@@ et@@ ed me in the local language .
