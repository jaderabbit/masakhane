GNOME is a Free, usable, stable, accessible desktop environment for the Unix-like family of operating systems.
GNOME includes most of what you see on your computer, including the file manager, web browser, menus, and many applications.
GNOME also includes a complete development platform for applications programmers, allowing the creation of powerful and complex applications.
GNOME's focus on usability and accessibility, regular release cycle, and strong corporate backing make it unique among Free Software desktops.
GNOME's greatest strength is our strong community. Virtually anyone, with or without coding skills, can contribute to making GNOME better.

Build Date
GNOME also includes a complete development platform for applications programmers, allowing the creation of powerful and complex applications.
GNOME includes most of what you see on your computer, including the file manager, web browser, menus, and many applications.
GNOME is a Free, usable, stable, accessible desktop environment for the Unix-like family of operating systems.
GNOME's focus on usability and accessibility, regular release cycle, and strong corporate backing make it unique among Free Software desktops.
GNOME's greatest strength is our strong community. Virtually anyone, with or without coding skills, can contribute to making GNOME better.

Hour format
This key specifies the hour format used by the clock applet. Possible values are "12-hour", "24-hour", "internet", "unix" and "custom". If set to "internet", the clock will display Internet time. The Internet time system divides the day into 1000 ".beats". There are no time zones in this system, so time is the same all over the world. If set to "unix", the clock will display time in seconds since Epoch, i.e. 1970-01-01. If set to "custom", the clock will display time according to the format specified in the custom_format key.
Custom format of the clock
This key specifies the format used by the clock applet when the format key is set to "custom". You can use conversion specifiers understood by strftime() to obtain a specific format. See the strftime() manual for more information.
Show time with seconds
If true, display seconds in time.
Show date in clock
If true, display date in the clock, in addition to time.
Show date in tooltip
If true, show date in a tooltip when the pointer is over the clock.
Show weather in clock
If true, display a weather icon.
Show temperature in clock
If true, show the temperature next to the weather icon.
Use UTC
If true, display time in Universal Coordinated Time zone.
Time configuration tool
The use of this key was deprecated in GNOME 2.22 with the use of an internal time configuration tool. The schema is retained for compatibility with older versions.
Show week numbers in calendar
If true, show week numbers in the calendar.
If true, expand the list of appointments in the calendar window.
If true, expand the list of birthdays in the calendar window.
If true, expand the list of tasks in the calendar window.
If true, expand the list of weather information in the calendar window.

From Whence That Stupid Fish Came
Fish
Display a swimming fish or another animated creature
Warning: The command appears to be something actually useful. Since this is a useless applet, you may not want to do this. We strongly advise you against using %s for anything which would make the applet "practical" or useful.

%s the Fish
%s has no use what-so-ever. It only takes up disk space and compilation time, and if loaded it also takes up precious panel space and memory. Anybody found using it should be promptly sent for a psychiatric evaluation.

Name to identify panel
This is a human readable name which you can use to identify a panel. Its main purpose is to serve as the panel's window title which is useful when navigating between panels.
X screen where the panel is displayed
With a multi-screen setup, you may have panels on each individual screen. This key identifies the current screen the panel is displayed on.
Xinerama monitor where the panel is displayed
In a Xinerama setup, you may have panels on each individual monitor. This key identifies the current monitor the panel is displayed on.
Expand to occupy entire screen width
If true, the panel will occupy the entire screen width (height if this is a vertical panel). In this mode the panel can only be placed at a screen edge. If false, the panel will only be large enough to accommodate the applets, launchers and buttons on the panel.
Panel orientation
The orientation of the panel. Possible values are "top", "bottom", "left", "right". In expanded mode the key specifies which screen edge the panel is on. In un-expanded mode the difference between "top" and "bottom" is less important - both indicate that this is a horizontal panel - but still give a useful hint as to how some panel objects should behave. For example, on a "top" panel a menu button will pop up its menu below the panel, whereas on a "bottom" panel the menu will be popped up above the panel.
Panel size
The height (width for a vertical panel) of the panel. The panel will determine at runtime a minimum size based on the font size and other indicators. The maximum size is fixed at one quarter of the screen height (or width).
X co-ordinate of panel
The location of the panel along the x-axis. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.
Y co-ordinate of panel
The location of the panel along the y-axis. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.
The location of the panel along the x-axis, starting from the right of the screen. If set to -1, the value is ignored and the value of the x key is used. If the value is greater than 0, then the value of the x key is ignored. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.
The location of the panel along the y-axis, starting from the bottom of the screen. If set to -1, the value is ignored and the value of the y key is used. If the value is greater than 0, then the value of the y key is ignored. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.
Center panel on x-axis
If true, the x and x_right keys are ignored and the panel is placed at the center of the x-axis of the screen. If the panel is resized it will remain at that position - i.e. the panel will grow on both sides. If false, the x and x_right keys specify the location of the panel.
Center panel on y-axis
If true, the y and y_bottom keys are ignored and the panel is placed at the center of the y-axis of the screen. If the panel is resized it will remain at that position - i.e. the panel will grow on both sides. If false, the y and y_bottom keys specify the location of the panel.
Automatically hide panel into corner
If true, the panel is automatically hidden into a corner of the screen when the pointer leaves the panel area. Moving the pointer to that corner again will cause the panel to re-appear.
If true, hiding and un-hiding of this panel will be animated rather than happening instantly.
Enable hide buttons
If true, buttons will be placed on each side of the panel which may be used to move the panel to edge of the screen, leaving only a button showing.
Enable arrows on hide buttons
If true, arrows will be placed on the hide buttons. This key is only relevant if the enable_buttons key is true.
Panel autohide delay
Specifies the number of milliseconds delay after the pointer leaves the panel area before the panel is automatically hidden. This key is only relevant if the auto_hide key is true.
Panel autounhide delay
Specifies the number of milliseconds delay after the pointer enters the panel area before the panel is automatically re-shown. This key is only relevant if the auto_hide key is true.
Visible pixels when hidden
Specifies the number of pixels visible when the panel is automatically hidden into a corner. This key is only relevant if the auto_hide key is true.
Animation speed

Hour format
This key specifies the hour format used by the clock applet. Possible values are "12-hour", "24-hour", "internet", "unix" and "custom". If set to "internet", the clock will display Internet time. The Internet time system divides the day into 1000 ".beats". There are no time zones in this system, so time is the same all over the world. If set to "unix", the clock will display time in seconds since Epoch, i.e. 1970-01-01. If set to "custom", the clock will display time according to the format specified in the custom_format key.
Custom format of the clock
This key specifies the format used by the clock applet when the format key is set to "custom". You can use conversion specifiers understood by strftime() to obtain a specific format. See the strftime() manual for more information.

Name to identify panel
This is a human readable name which you can use to identify a panel. Its main purpose is to serve as the panel's window title which is useful when navigating between panels.
X screen where the panel is displayed
With a multi-screen setup, you may have panels on each individual screen. This key identifies the current screen the panel is displayed on.
Xinerama monitor where the panel is displayed
In a Xinerama setup, you may have panels on each individual monitor. This key identifies the current monitor the panel is displayed on.
Expand to occupy entire screen width
If true, the panel will occupy the entire screen width (height if this is a vertical panel). In this mode the panel can only be placed at a screen edge. If false, the panel will only be large enough to accommodate the applets, launchers and buttons on the panel.
Panel orientation
The orientation of the panel. Possible values are "top", "bottom", "left", "right". In expanded mode the key specifies which screen edge the panel is on. In un-expanded mode the difference between "top" and "bottom" is less important - both indicate that this is a horizontal panel - but still give a useful hint as to how some panel objects should behave. For example, on a "top" panel a menu button will pop up its menu below the panel, whereas on a "bottom" panel the menu will be popped up above the panel.
Panel size
The height (width for a vertical panel) of the panel. The panel will determine at runtime a minimum size based on the font size and other indicators. The maximum size is fixed at one quarter of the screen height (or width).
X co-ordinate of panel
The location of the panel along the x-axis. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.
Y co-ordinate of panel
The location of the panel along the y-axis. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.
The location of the panel along the x-axis, starting from the right of the screen. If set to -1, the value is ignored and the value of the x key is used. If the value is greater than 0, then the value of the x key is ignored. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.
The location of the panel along the y-axis, starting from the bottom of the screen. If set to -1, the value is ignored and the value of the y key is used. If the value is greater than 0, then the value of the y key is ignored. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.
Center panel on x-axis
If true, the x and x_right keys are ignored and the panel is placed at the center of the x-axis of the screen. If the panel is resized it will remain at that position - i.e. the panel will grow on both sides. If false, the x and x_right keys specify the location of the panel.
Center panel on y-axis
If true, the y and y_bottom keys are ignored and the panel is placed at the center of the y-axis of the screen. If the panel is resized it will remain at that position - i.e. the panel will grow on both sides. If false, the y and y_bottom keys specify the location of the panel.
Automatically hide panel into corner
If true, the panel is automatically hidden into a corner of the screen when the pointer leaves the panel area. Moving the pointer to that corner again will cause the panel to re-appear.
If true, hiding and un-hiding of this panel will be animated rather than happening instantly.
Enable hide buttons
If true, buttons will be placed on each side of the panel which may be used to move the panel to edge of the screen, leaving only a button showing.
Enable arrows on hide buttons
If true, arrows will be placed on the hide buttons. This key is only relevant if the enable_buttons key is true.
Panel autohide delay
Specifies the number of milliseconds delay after the pointer leaves the panel area before the panel is automatically hidden. This key is only relevant if the auto_hide key is true.
Panel autounhide delay
Specifies the number of milliseconds delay after the pointer enters the panel area before the panel is automatically re-shown. This key is only relevant if the auto_hide key is true.
Visible pixels when hidden
Specifies the number of pixels visible when the panel is automatically hidden into a corner. This key is only relevant if the auto_hide key is true.
Animation speed
The speed in which panel animations should occur. Possible values are "slow", "medium" and "fast". This key is only relevant if the enable_animations key is true.
Background type
Which type of background should be used for this panel. Possible values are "gtk" - the default GTK+ widget background will be used, "color" - the color key will be used as background color or "image" - the image specified by the image key will be used as background.
Background color
Specifies the background color for the panel in #RGB format.
Background color opacity
Specifies the opacity of the background color format. If the color is not completely opaque (a value of less than 65535), the color will be composited onto the desktop background image.
Background image
Specifies the file to be used for the background image. If the image contains an alpha channel it will be composited onto the desktop background image.
Fit image to panel
If true, the image will be scaled (retaining the aspect ratio of the image) to the panel height (if horizontal).
Stretch image to panel
If true, the image will be scaled to the panel dimensions. The aspect ratio of the image will not be maintained.
Rotate image on vertical panels
If true, the background image will be rotated when the panel is oriented vertically.

Name to identify panel
This is a human readable name which you can use to identify a panel. Its main purpose is to serve as the panel's window title which is useful when navigating between panels.
X screen where the panel is displayed
With a multi-screen setup, you may have panels on each individual screen. This key identifies the current screen the panel is displayed on.
Xinerama monitor where the panel is displayed
In a Xinerama setup, you may have panels on each individual monitor. This key identifies the current monitor the panel is displayed on.
Expand to occupy entire screen width
If true, the panel will occupy the entire screen width (height if this is a vertical panel). In this mode the panel can only be placed at a screen edge. If false, the panel will only be large enough to accommodate the applets, launchers and buttons on the panel.
Panel orientation
The orientation of the panel. Possible values are "top", "bottom", "left", "right". In expanded mode the key specifies which screen edge the panel is on. In un-expanded mode the difference between "top" and "bottom" is less important - both indicate that this is a horizontal panel - but still give a useful hint as to how some panel objects should behave. For example, on a "top" panel a menu button will pop up its menu below the panel, whereas on a "bottom" panel the menu will be popped up above the panel.
Panel size
The height (width for a vertical panel) of the panel. The panel will determine at runtime a minimum size based on the font size and other indicators. The maximum size is fixed at one quarter of the screen height (or width).
X co-ordinate of panel
The location of the panel along the x-axis. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.
Y co-ordinate of panel
The location of the panel along the y-axis. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.
The location of the panel along the x-axis, starting from the right of the screen. If set to -1, the value is ignored and the value of the x key is used. If the value is greater than 0, then the value of the x key is ignored. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.
The location of the panel along the y-axis, starting from the bottom of the screen. If set to -1, the value is ignored and the value of the y key is used. If the value is greater than 0, then the value of the y key is ignored. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.
Center panel on x-axis
If true, the x and x_right keys are ignored and the panel is placed at the center of the x-axis of the screen. If the panel is resized it will remain at that position - i.e. the panel will grow on both sides. If false, the x and x_right keys specify the location of the panel.
Center panel on y-axis
If true, the y and y_bottom keys are ignored and the panel is placed at the center of the y-axis of the screen. If the panel is resized it will remain at that position - i.e. the panel will grow on both sides. If false, the y and y_bottom keys specify the location of the panel.
Automatically hide panel into corner
If true, the panel is automatically hidden into a corner of the screen when the pointer leaves the panel area. Moving the pointer to that corner again will cause the panel to re-appear.
If true, hiding and un-hiding of this panel will be animated rather than happening instantly.
Enable hide buttons
If true, buttons will be placed on each side of the panel which may be used to move the panel to edge of the screen, leaving only a button showing.
Enable arrows on hide buttons
If true, arrows will be placed on the hide buttons. This key is only relevant if the enable_buttons key is true.
Panel autohide delay
Specifies the number of milliseconds delay after the pointer leaves the panel area before the panel is automatically hidden. This key is only relevant if the auto_hide key is true.
Panel autounhide delay
Specifies the number of milliseconds delay after the pointer enters the panel area before the panel is automatically re-shown. This key is only relevant if the auto_hide key is true.
Visible pixels when hidden
Specifies the number of pixels visible when the panel is automatically hidden into a corner. This key is only relevant if the auto_hide key is true.
Animation speed
The speed in which panel animations should occur. Possible values are "slow", "medium" and "fast". This key is only relevant if the enable_animations key is true.
Background type
Which type of background should be used for this panel. Possible values are "gtk" - the default GTK+ widget background will be used, "color" - the color key will be used as background color or "image" - the image specified by the image key will be used as background.
Background color
Specifies the background color for the panel in #RGB format.
Background color opacity
Specifies the opacity of the background color format. If the color is not completely opaque (a value of less than 65535), the color will be composited onto the desktop background image.
Background image
Specifies the file to be used for the background image. If the image contains an alpha channel it will be composited onto the desktop background image.
Fit image to panel
If true, the image will be scaled (retaining the aspect ratio of the image) to the panel height (if horizontal).
Stretch image to panel
If true, the image will be scaled to the panel dimensions. The aspect ratio of the image will not be maintained.
Rotate image on vertical panels
If true, the background image will be rotated when the panel is oriented vertically.

Interpret position relative to bottom/right edge
If set to 'end', the position of the object is interpreted relative to the right (or bottom if vertical) edge of the panel.
Object's position on the panel
The position of this panel object. The position is specified by the number of pixels from the left (or top if vertical) panel edge.
Name to identify panel
This is a human readable name which you can use to identify a panel. Its main purpose is to serve as the panel's window title which is useful when navigating between panels.
X screen where the panel is displayed
With a multi-screen setup, you may have panels on each individual screen. This key identifies the current screen the panel is displayed on.
Xinerama monitor where the panel is displayed
In a Xinerama setup, you may have panels on each individual monitor. This key identifies the current monitor the panel is displayed on.
Expand to occupy entire screen width
If true, the panel will occupy the entire screen width (height if this is a vertical panel). In this mode the panel can only be placed at a screen edge. If false, the panel will only be large enough to accommodate the applets, launchers and buttons on the panel.
Panel orientation
The orientation of the panel. Possible values are "top", "bottom", "left", "right". In expanded mode the key specifies which screen edge the panel is on. In un-expanded mode the difference between "top" and "bottom" is less important - both indicate that this is a horizontal panel - but still give a useful hint as to how some panel objects should behave. For example, on a "top" panel a menu button will pop up its menu below the panel, whereas on a "bottom" panel the menu will be popped up above the panel.
Panel size
The height (width for a vertical panel) of the panel. The panel will determine at runtime a minimum size based on the font size and other indicators. The maximum size is fixed at one quarter of the screen height (or width).
X co-ordinate of panel
The location of the panel along the x-axis. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.

The location of the panel along the y-axis. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.
The location of the panel along the x-axis, starting from the right of the screen. If set to -1, the value is ignored and the value of the x key is used. If the value is greater than 0, then the value of the x key is ignored. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.
The location of the panel along the y-axis, starting from the bottom of the screen. If set to -1, the value is ignored and the value of the y key is used. If the value is greater than 0, then the value of the y key is ignored. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.
Center panel on x-axis
If true, the x and x_right keys are ignored and the panel is placed at the center of the x-axis of the screen. If the panel is resized it will remain at that position - i.e. the panel will grow on both sides. If false, the x and x_right keys specify the location of the panel.
Center panel on y-axis
If true, the y and y_bottom keys are ignored and the panel is placed at the center of the y-axis of the screen. If the panel is resized it will remain at that position - i.e. the panel will grow on both sides. If false, the y and y_bottom keys specify the location of the panel.

The location of the panel along the x-axis, starting from the right of the screen. If set to -1, the value is ignored and the value of the x key is used. If the value is greater than 0, then the value of the x key is ignored. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.
The location of the panel along the y-axis, starting from the bottom of the screen. If set to -1, the value is ignored and the value of the y key is used. If the value is greater than 0, then the value of the y key is ignored. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.
Center panel on x-axis
If true, the x and x_right keys are ignored and the panel is placed at the center of the x-axis of the screen. If the panel is resized it will remain at that position - i.e. the panel will grow on both sides. If false, the x and x_right keys specify the location of the panel.
Center panel on y-axis
If true, the y and y_bottom keys are ignored and the panel is placed at the center of the y-axis of the screen. If the panel is resized it will remain at that position - i.e. the panel will grow on both sides. If false, the y and y_bottom keys specify the location of the panel.

The format looks like "<Control>a" or "<Shift><Alt>F1". The parser is fairly liberal and allows lower or upper case, and also abbreviations such as "<Ctl>" and "<Ctrl>". If you set the option to the special string "disabled", then there will be no keybinding for this action.

If you set the option to the special string "disabled", then there will be no keybinding for this action. This keybinding may be reversed by holding down the "shift" key; therefore, "shift" cannot be one of the keys it uses.
